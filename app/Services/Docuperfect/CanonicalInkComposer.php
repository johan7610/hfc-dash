/**
 * ESIGN-WETINK Phase 1c — bake a party's ink INTO the canonical artifact.
 *
 * The wet-ink doctrine (ESIGN-WETINK.md I3): when a party fills a field,
 * initials, or signs, that ink is composed INTO the ONE canonical HTML and
 * persisted — it becomes part of the document body, NOT a per-viewer overlay
 * filtered by `is_mine`. After party N completes, `canonical_html` literally
 * contains party N's signature image / initials / field values, so party N+1
 * loads that same artifact and sees them because they ARE the document.
 *
 * The NEW piece the doctrine calls out is IDENTITY-SCOPING: every party's ink
 * must stay distinct. The old `embedSignaturesIntoHtml` matched by party ALIAS
 * (`data-marker-party`), so its "fill every same-party surface" fallback bled
 * seller-1's signature onto seller-2's markers (gap audit finding (b)). Here we
 * match by `data-recipient-identity="{role}_{index}"` — the per-recipient stamp
 * the expansion now writes onto every marker inside a cloned block — so party
 * N's ink lands ONLY on party N's positions.
 *
 * N-PARTY: identity is resolved from the SignatureRequest at runtime
 * (`role_identity`); there is no `seller_1`/`seller_2` assumption and no ceiling
 * on same-role recipients.
 *
 * Fail-safe: any parse/DOM failure returns the input HTML unchanged — a
 * document that keeps its prior state is always safer than a 500 at signing.

     * runs ONLY inside compose() (CanonicalDocumentRenderer), which per the

     *     this one, because ids are guaranteed unique. Stamped by
     *     RoleBlockExpansionService's per-recipient clone loop onto every marker
     *     it clones; ABSENT on any canonical composed before this fix, and on
     *     the entity-representative DISPLAY clones CanonicalDocumentRenderer::
     *     expandRepresentedEntitiesForDisplay() builds via replicate() (those are
     *     never persisted, so they carry no id to stamp) — both fall through to

     *     an already-composed document's markers (no such attribute anywhere)
     *     compose identically to before.
     *  1. `data-name` — the merged_html binds EVERY signature/initial marker to
     *     the exact person it belongs to (`data-name="Anine Van der Westhuizen"`).

     *     markers carry NO data-recipient-identity). This is the fix for the
     *     "agent review / next party shows NO recipient ink" defect: seller_1's
     *     ink was matching nothing because the seller markers are name-bound, not
     *     identity-stamped, and the sole-of-role party fallback is (correctly)
     *     disabled for a 2-seller document. NOTE: this is exactly the key step 0
     *     now takes priority over — two signers sharing a name collide here,
     *     which is why any marker carrying step 0's stronger key is decided by
     *     step 0 and never reaches this comparison at all.
     *  2. `data-recipient-identity` — markers stamped inside cloned role-blocks.
     *  3. Party-alias fallback — ONLY when the signer is the sole recipient of
     *     their role (agent, single seller/buyer); safe because there is no
     *     same-role sibling to bleed onto. For a non-sole signer an un-keyed
     *     marker is left blank (safer than contaminated).
     *
     * A marker that carries a data-name for a DIFFERENT person is never filled by
     * this signer (step 1 returns false), so there is no cross-party bleed.
