/**
 * AT-332 — Johan, verbatim: "re-auth only allowed by original auth party."
 * After a recipient amends a document, re-authorisation must come from the
 * SAME user who authorised the original — not the party slot, not any
 * other full-status agent with document-edit permission. Must survive
 * multiple amendment rounds: signature_requests.authorised_by is a
 * write-once column (SignatureService.php ~1510/1542 — `?? auth()->id()`
 * guard) on the supervisor/supervisor_final row, and that row is reused
 * (never recreated) by requeueAllPartiesForInitialing() across every
 * amendment round, so the bound user stays the same every time.
 *
 * Closes three previously-unbound re-approval paths (2026-08 audit —
 * .ai/audits/2026-08-01-candidate-authoriser-signing-coupling.md):
 * AmendmentController::approve(), SignatureController::amendmentAction()
 * (which bulk-accepted every pending AmendmentAcceptance row with no check
 * at all), and SignatureController::approveAmendmentNode(). All three
 * previously only checked scope (guardDocument() — agency/branch/owner),
 * never identity — any full-status agent with documents.edit in scope
 * could re-authorise someone else's amendment.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT throw/403 — Johan: "A blocked agent gets a clear
 * message naming who authorised the original — never a 403." Callers get
 * a plain-language block reason back and redirect with it, exactly like
 * every other user-facing failure in this pipeline.
 *
 * Unconditional (Johan, 2026-09-07): "No, this is not settings but fixes
 * we are building." Not agency-configurable — there was briefly an
 * EsignSettings::strictReauthorisationBinding() toggle here; it was
 * removed (2026_09_07_025135) because "the person who authorised it is
 * the person who re-authorises it" is not a preference an agency gets to
 * switch off.
