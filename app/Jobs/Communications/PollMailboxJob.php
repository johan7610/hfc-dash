 * A failure here is logged and retried by the queue — never silently dropped.
 *
 * ShouldBeUnique per mailbox (queue-starvation fix): a mailbox stays "due"
 * until its poll COMPLETES and stamps last_polled_at, but IMAP polls are slow
 * (5-30s). Without a uniqueness guard the every-5-min scheduler re-dispatches
 * the same mailboxes while their previous poll is still queued/running, so the
 * default queue amplifies unboundedly (~5x observed live) and wedges. The
 * unique lock collapses those duplicates: a re-dispatch is a no-op while a
 * poll for the same mailbox is already pending or in flight. `uniqueFor` is a
 * safety valve (≤ the 15-min interval) so a crashed job can never block a
 * mailbox for more than one cycle.
