     * THE RULE, stated as the law states it — Johan, from his own reading:
     * "the law states you may not spend more than 30% of your gross
     * income on rentals... its not 3.5 or what you created it as of nett
     * disposable income. its of the gross income." Rent must not exceed
     * $maxRentPercent% of GROSS income. Not a multiplier of rent (the same
     * arithmetic wearing a disguise — nobody could check a "3.5x" figure
     * against the actual legal guideline at a glance), not net-of-expenses
     * (confirmed before this change: the OLD version already tested
     * income-before-expenses against the threshold, matching the law's own
     * "gross" basis by coincidence of arithmetic direction, not by
     * design — this version makes that basis explicit and correct).
     *
     * Round 12 — Johan, plainly, after being asked to confirm and finding
     * the question itself confusing: "agent captures income on right
     * panel. choses to say 3 months - so whatever the agent captured get
     * averaged by the months selected - 10000, 10000, 13000 tallies to
     * 33000, agent selected 3 months - so the avg income is? 11000?"
     * THE FIGURE THE 30% RULE RUNS AGAINST IS NOW THE MONTHLY AVERAGE
     * (captured total ÷ statement_months), never the raw multi-month lump
     * sum — a bank statement's total is meaningless against a MONTHLY
     * legal threshold without dividing it down first. Same arithmetic for
     * expenses, so net_income stays an apples-to-apples monthly figure.
     *
     * Requires BOTH captured income AND a valid statement_months (a
     * positive whole number — enforced at validation, defended again
     * here) to compute anything: neither alone is enough, and a missing/
     * zero months figure must never divide, silently show a wrong number,
     * or fall back to treating the raw total as if it were monthly.
     * Rounding: round-half-up to the nearest cent (PHP's own round($n, 2)
     * default), same as every other money figure this method returns.
     *
     * SUGGESTIVE, NEVER A RULE. Johan, verbatim: "The marking is only
     * suggestive to the agent to spot. not rule of thumb." This method
     * never blocks, never auto-declines, never writes a decision anywhere
     * — it only returns numbers and a label for the agent to read. Returns
     * null fields when there isn't enough input to compute anything
     * (never a misleading zero).
     *
     * `net_income` is still computed and returned — Johan's explicit call,
     * kept as genuinely useful context an agent typed in themselves (what's
     * left after existing debts/expenses), but it plays NO part in
     * `meets_threshold`. Any screen that displays it must label it
     * unmistakably as reference-only, separated from the pass/fail badge —
     * the OLD screen showed it unlabelled next to the badge, which is
     * exactly what made an agent reasonably assume it was being tested.
     *
     * Round 16 — Johan: "the affordability check is currently testing the
     * applicant's SELF-REPORTED CURRENT RENT, not the rent of the property
     * being applied for... If no property is linked, the check must say
     * it cannot run rather than testing the wrong number." `rent` now
     * comes from the LINKED PROPERTY's own rental_amount, never
     * current_rental_amount (that column is the applicant's own current,
     * pre-move residence — irrelevant to whether they can afford the
     * property they're actually applying for). `property_linked` is
     * returned explicitly so the view can say plainly why no pass/fail
     * exists yet, rather than silently showing nothing or (worse) falling
     * back to the wrong rent. The QUALIFYING CEILING itself
     * (max_affordable_rent) does NOT need a property — it's purely a
     * function of captured income — so it still computes and displays as
     * soon as income+months exist; only the pass/fail comparison against
     * an actual rent additionally needs the property link.
