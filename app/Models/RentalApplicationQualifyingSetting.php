/**
 * AT-392 Phase 2 — Johan: "qualifying formula - agency can set this."
 * Deliberately follows STANDARDS.md Rule 17's safe pattern: forAgency()
 * NEVER creates a row on read, only returns a sensible in-memory default
 * when the agency has never opened the settings screen. A row is only
 * ever written when the agency explicitly saves.
 *
 * 2026-09-08 — replaced income_to_rent_multiplier (a multiplier of rent,
 * ~3x, worked out to roughly 33% of income by coincidence of arithmetic)
 * with the actual legal figure: rent must not exceed 30% of GROSS
 * income (Johan, from his own reading of the law). The law sets a
 * CEILING, not a fixed number — an agency may set a STRICTER (lower)
 * figure, but the figure it applies to (gross income) is never itself
 * configurable. No real agency had ever configured the old column at
 * the point of this migration (the one row that existed was a leftover
 * test artifact from an earlier round, cleaned up separately) — a clean
 * replace, not a second column living alongside the first.
