/**
 * AT-URGENT-2026-09-08 — Johan: "if I hit a test send from any of the test
 * sites it will mail actual people... the per-mailbox outgoing SMTP work
 * means the application now connects directly to a real mail server...
 * Laravel's MAIL_MAILER setting in .env does NOT intercept that path."
 *
 * This is the single, hardcoded gate every outbound-mail interception point
 * calls before allowing a real send. It is deliberately NOT a setting: no
 * database row, no agency config, no per-user toggle — only two signals a
 * person using the app can never reach: APP_ENV and the configured APP_URL
 * host, checked against a hardcoded allow-list baked into this file.
 *
 * BOTH signals must agree before a real send is allowed. One signal alone
 * is not enough: live-testing.corexos.co.za was documented (2026-08-27,
 * .ai/releases/2026-08-27-staging-live-testing-and-esign-plan.md) as "the
 * old live box, repurposed" — carrying the same /corex codebase path
 * convention as real production. A box like that could plausibly end up
 * with APP_ENV=production set (inherited, copied, or mistaken) while its
 * real hostname is not corexos.co.za. Checking APP_ENV alone would treat
 * it as production and leave it unguarded — exactly the failure mode this
 * exists to prevent. Checking the hostname alone would be defeated by a
 * stale/wrong APP_URL on the real production box. Requiring both closes
 * that gap without depending on any single value being right forever.
 *
 * Fail-safe direction: if either signal is missing, blank, malformed, or
 * does not exactly match, this returns false (NOT production) — mail is
 * guarded. The only way to open the gate is an exact, positive match on
 * both. A missing or broken config value can only ever make this MORE
 * restrictive, never less.
