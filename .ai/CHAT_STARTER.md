<!-- ============================================================ -->

## 1. Identity & Stack

**Who:** Johan Reichel (CEO, HFC). Andre Roets (full-stack dev). Two-person team building CoreX OS — real estate operating system. HFC (Home Finders Coastal) is the first live agency. Long-term vision: SA's leading real estate OS, replacing PropCon / Sage / Property24 layers across the industry.

**Stack:** Laravel 12 / Blade / Alpine.js. MySQL prod (`hfc_corex`, `hfc_staging`). SQLite local. Vite. Ubuntu on Hetzner `91.99.130.85`. Code at `/hfc` (live) and `/hfc-staging`. Python AI service `/opt/hf-ai/app.py` port 3100 (not in git).

**Domain:** `corex.hfcoastal.co.za` live. Staging on port 8084.

**Branches:** `main` (live), `Staging`, `HFC2402` (Johan dev), `andre` (Andre dev), feature branches off Staging. Discipline: HFC2402 + andre → Staging → staging server → main → live. Hotfix exception: direct to main, then back-sync to Staging.

**VS Code Claude** is the coding agent. Johan pastes prompts, it executes. Specs in `.ai/specs/`, read at start of every prompt.

## 2. Working Rules

- **Investigate before fixing.** Every issue: (1) audit, (2) Johan approves fix approach, (3) only then fix prompt. Never guess root causes.
- **One concern per prompt.** Two only if tightly related and same file.
- **Surgical changes.** No refactoring beyond scope.
- **Every prompt opens:** read CLAUDE.md, .ai/STANDARDS.md, relevant spec, and this file.
- **Every prompt closes:** php -l, php artisan view:clear, scripts/dev-check.ps1 if structural change, Tinker verification, **update this CHAT_STARTER.md**.
- **No hard deletes.** SoftDeletes only.
- **PPRA not EAAB. POPIA consent rules apply.**
- **Bug report = code is wrong.** Never blame caching or user error.

## 3. State of the build

### 3.1 LIVE (production or staging — agents using or about to)

- **Agency Tracker** — deal register, settlements, commission engine, finance audit, daily activity points, branch performance

- **Prospecting module** — Chrome extension, claim system 48h auto-expiry, seller-outreach compose flow, cross-portal dedup
- **Private Property sandbox** — SOAP Agency Feed Rev 4.6, listing T2870133 submitted
- **Property24 ExDev sandbox** — Listing Service v53, agency 31357 (in progress: env var issue)
- **Map workspace A.1–A.3 + A.2.7** — composite pins, action mapping, view modes, search/filter/saved searches, hover summaries, contact ID capture, GPS prospect collision
- **MIC** — 8 modules: Market Pulse, Content Studio, Listing Marketing, Social Hub, Campaigns, Newsletter, Scheduler, Analytics
- **Calendar Module** — RAG events, event classes, leave/birthday/holiday as informational vs actionable, Module 2.5 multi-property, Module 3 done, iCal per scope
- **Domain Events architecture** — spec at `.ai/specs/corex-domain-events-spec.md`, event bus + observers + queued listeners
- **Property cross-reference + unified buyer wishlist + buyer matching engine**
- **Commission & Revenue Share Engine** — 7 tables, bcmath, agent dashboard, principal P&L, sponsor tree
- **Branch Isolation** — spec built, 14 prompts A–N
- **Tax / Payroll** — SARS e@syFile IT3(a) submission for tax year ending Feb 2026
- **Presentations V2 phases 4–7** — snapshot links + engagement tracking (FirstViewed + FlaggedAccess notifications) / teaser route + lead capture / send-to-recipient delivery (whatsapp + email, sticky defaults) / refresh-request flow with "data may be dated" banner (default 21d, agency-configurable 7–90), 3/10min rate limit, supersession auto-redirect. All 5 tables present (`presentation_snapshot_links`, `presentation_snapshot_views`, `presentation_teaser_leads`, `presentation_deliveries`, `presentation_refresh_requests`). End-to-end flow verified working today.
- **Phase 9c POPIA trilogy** — (1) PPRA per-entity column on `agencies` + `branches` with branch→agency cascade, settings UI, `corex-document` mislabel fix, agent-footer + RCR export renders. (2) `information_officer_appointments` mirroring FICA pattern (primary + deputies, auto-end-old-primary), admin UI in Compliance Settings (POPIA s55 + s56), permission `manage_information_officer`, 5 lifecycle tests. (3) **Privacy policy: editable markdown field in Company Settings (mirrors Email Disclaimer pattern) + per-branch override (plain column names per existing override convention) + public token route at `/legal/privacy/{token}` + `Agency::effectivePopiUrl()` cascades internal published → external `popi_url` → null. Branch model has matching `effectivePopiUrl()` + `effectivePrivacyPolicyUrl()` helpers. 8 tests passing.** _(Phase 9c-3's prior `company_documents` table was rolled back 2026-05-26 per the documents-infrastructure audit — replaced by this field-based pattern.)_

### 3.2 IN FLIGHT

- **Branch `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`** — MIC collision fix (A.3.4) + M22 test fix + universal-signature audit + small fixes (419 / CMA logo / Tools logo) + **complete Phase 9c trilogy** (PPRA per agency+branch, Information Officer appointments, Company Documents infrastructure with `/legal/{token}` public links) all shipped. **Module 6 (Activity Points Engine) M6.0 + M6.1 + M6.2 shipped:** investigation + schema foundation (scope/agency_id, point_state/source/calendar_event_id/override audit, Eloquent ActivityDefinition + DailyActivityEntry models, 41 defs backfilled system, 1,492 entries backfilled confirmed/manual) + per-agency mapping table `activity_definition_calendar_classes` with admin UI at `/admin/activity-mappings` (CRUD + toggle, permission `manage_activity_mappings`, `resolveForEvent()` helper for M6.3). M6.3 (observer + provisional points + anti-gaming + audit table), M6.4 (confirm hook + revoke command + override service), M6.5 (daily view + override UI) ahead in next session.
- **Next:** Andre — Staging deploy + live DB pull. Figure-matching audit on staging.

### 3.3 SPECCED / partial — not fully built

- **Universal signature feature** — Layer 1 (upload tab in signing modal) + Layer 2 (stored signature on user profile) specced March 2026. Build state unconfirmed pending audit. Vision: apply pre-fill to every signature capture surface (FICA ack, RMCP ack, training, deal step sign-off) where signatory is authenticated user.
- **Tenant pre-approval** (TVA integration)
- **Inspection reports module**
- **Statistics tile builder** ("See every number the way you want to see it")
- **Map A.4 / A.5 / A.6** — logo pins, viewport pagination, mode pills (Opportunities / Analyse / Seller / Buyer)
- **CoreGolf** — Johan's personal project, Huawei GT6 Pro ArkTS app
- **Module 4 (Buyer CRM) + Module 5 (Seller Live Link)** — calendar follow-on
- **Deal Register V2** — full spec written
- **Sales pipeline + Rental pipeline views**

### 3.4 PARKED / future

- **Phase 9e** — 6 audit M-fixes + 5 deferred 9d.2 items
- **System-wide back-nav audit**
- **User activity tracking spec**
- **4 strategic spec pillars** — compliance philosophy, integration philosophy, supplier partnership thesis, naming canon
- **Auto activity tracking + Exclusive auto-notification**
- **CDS importer path** — keep or retire? (decided: hand-crafted Blade is the path; CDS legacy support TBD)
- **Accounting module** — long-term Sage replacement

## 4. Recent decisions log (last 15, newest top)

- **2026-05-26** — E-Sign full state audit completed; report at `.ai/audits/esign-full-state-audit-2026-05-26.md` — comprehensive map of current state vs wet-ink target for Johan's strategic call. Headline: amendment surface was simplified (flag-based) 6h before the demo via Phase 1B.6 (commit 7521e63), NOT torn out; strikethrough endpoint returns 410 Gone deliberately; `editable_by` server-side logic at SigningController:1347-1385 reads correct per code but never operationally verified — gap between Johan's locked-fields report and the audit needs live-test resolution.
- **2026-05-26** — Rolled back Phase 9c-3 over-build. Privacy policy now lives as Company Settings field next to Email Disclaimer with branch override (plain column names, mirrors existing override convention). Public URL via `/legal/privacy/{token}`. `effectivePopiUrl()` accessor cascades internal published → external `popi_url` → null. Documents-infrastructure audit confirmed Phase 9c-3 duplicated scope of pre-existing `agency_compliance_provisions` system — table dropped, files deleted, replaced with field pattern.
- **2026-05-25** — Module 6 M6.2 shipped: `activity_definition_calendar_classes` mapping table (agency_id + event_class slug + activity_definition_id + value_per_event + requires_feedback + auto_revoke_after_hours + daily_cap + back_date_limit_hours + is_active). Model with `resolveForEvent(CalendarEvent)` static helper, admin CRUD at `/admin/activity-mappings`, permission `manage_activity_mappings`. 6 tests passing. Schema deviation from prompt: mapping keys off event_class slug not FK (real schema has `calendar_event_class_settings` + `calendar_events.category` string, no `calendar_event_classes` table). Stopping here for the session; M6.3 + M6.4 + M6.5 in next session per honest-scope rule.
- **2026-05-25** — Module 6 M6.1 shipped: activity_definitions gains scope/agency_id (varchar — `system`/`agency` enforced at model layer); daily_activity_entries gains point_state/source/calendar_event_id/confirmed_at/revoked_at/override metadata. New ActivityDefinition + DailyActivityEntry Eloquent models. 41 definitions backfilled to `system` (global → system rename). 1,492 entries backfilled to confirmed/manual. 7 tests passing.
- **2026-05-25** — Module 6 M6.0 investigation complete; report at `.ai/audits/activity-points-integration-investigation-2026-05-25.md`. Findings drove decisions: scope is varchar (not enum); 46 calendar event classes (4 buyer-facing); CalendarEventFeedbackObserver exists (M6.4 hook surface); no CalendarEvent observer yet (M6.3 creates it); zero architectural surprises.
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-3 (Company Documents) shipped: `company_documents` table with token-based public `/legal/{token}` route mirrors `presentation_snapshot_links` pattern. Markdown content with admin live-preview editor. 6 curated types (privacy, T&Cs, complaints, AML, code of conduct, POPIA consent). Agency `privacy_policy_url` accessor cascades published doc → legacy `popi_url`. Phase 9c trilogy now LIVE.
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-2 (Information Officer) shipped: `information_officer_appointments` mirrors FICA pattern (primary + deputies, auto-end-old-primary). Admin UI under Compliance Settings, permission `manage_information_officer`, 5 lifecycle tests passing.
- **2026-05-25** — CDS template-creation investigation completed; report at `.ai/audits/cds-template-creation-investigation-2026-05-25.md`. 125 templates total (28 CDS, 3 hand-crafted, 22 importer, 72 legacy). 71% multi-tenant safe. April hand-crafted-Blade decision stands. Brief ready for tomorrow's joint session.
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-1 (PPRA number) shipped: agencies + branches columns + settings UI + corex-document mislabel fix + agent-footer + RCR export. Branch-overrides-agency cascade verified via Tinker.
- **2026-05-25** — Presentations V2 phases 4–7 audit completed; report at `.ai/audits/presentations-v2-phases-4-7-audit-2026-05-25.md`. All four phases ✅ fully built; moved into section 3.1 LIVE. End-to-end "4-month-old link → banner → refresh request → agent notified" flow operational.
- **2026-05-25** — POPIA columns investigation completed; report at `.ai/audits/popia-columns-investigation-2026-05-25.md`. Conclusion: `ffc_no` ≠ PPRA reg number (legally distinct under PPA 22/2019). Phase 9c rename-vs-add decision = ADD new column.
- **2026-05-25** — CLAUDE.md tightened: subagents producing audit/report files MUST write to disk via file-write tools, not return content in chat only (response to tonight's universal-signature subagent that skipped the write step).
- **2026-05-25** — Tonight's batch: 419 redirect + CMA cert logo + Tools page logo all shipped on `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`. Agency `logo_path` is now the canonical logo source for Tools (wins over stale `PerformanceSetting.company_logo_url`).
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c investigation: privacy policy + Information Officer + agency PPRA number — findings reported, moved from PARKED to IN FLIGHT; awaiting architectural decisions before fix.
- **2026-04-29** — Architecture: Claude owns template design centrally. Hand-crafted Blade with declarative metadata, bypass CDS UI. Templates 116/117/119 first under this model.

## 5. Outstanding small fixes (none blocking)

- _(none open as of 2026-05-25 — 419 / CMA logo / Tools logo all shipped tonight)_

## 6. Next likely move

Branch `feature/map-workspace-overhaul` carries everything from tonight: A.3.4 MIC fix + M22 test + 419 + CMA + Tools logo + chat starter + 4 audit reports + **complete Phase 9c trilogy** (PPRA, Information Officer, Company Documents). All 9c POPIA blockers closed. Next when Johan returns: (1) populate HFC's PPRA numbers + appoint Elize as primary IO + draft+publish HFC privacy policy via Tinker; (2) tomorrow's CDS architecture session (brief at `.ai/audits/cds-template-creation-investigation-2026-05-25.md`); (3) merge feature branch → Staging; (4) Andre pulls live DB, walks map + MIC + e-sign + Phase 9c surfaces on staging; (5) figure-matching audit; (6) decide whether universal-signature pre-fill (Layer 2) makes the 1 Aug cut. Bug-hunt week from 2 June.
