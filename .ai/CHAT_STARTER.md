## 1. Identity & Stack

**Who:** Johan Reichel (CEO, HFC). Andre Roets (full-stack dev). Two-person team building CoreX OS — real estate operating system. HFC (Home Finders Coastal) is the first live agency. Long-term vision: SA's leading real estate OS, replacing PropCon / Sage / Property24 layers across the industry.

**Stack:** Laravel 12 / Blade / Alpine.js. MySQL prod (`hfc_corex`, `hfc_staging`). SQLite local. Vite. Ubuntu on Hetzner `91.99.130.85`. Code at `/hfc` (live) and `/hfc-staging`. Python AI service `/opt/hf-ai/app.py` port 3100 (not in git).

**Domain:** `corex.hfcoastal.co.za` live. Staging on port 8084.

**Branches:** `main` (live), `Staging`, `HFC2402` (Johan dev), `andre` (Andre dev), feature branches off Staging. Discipline: HFC2402 + andre → Staging → staging server → main → live. Hotfix exception: direct to main, then back-sync to Staging.

**VS Code Claude** is the coding agent. Johan pastes prompts, it executes. Specs in `.ai/specs/`, read at start of every prompt.

## 2. Working Rules

- **Investigate before fixing.** Every issue: (1) audit, (2) Johan approves fix approach, (3) only then fix prompt. Never guess root causes.
- **One concern per prompt.** Two only if tightly related and same file.
- **Surgical changes.** No refactoring beyond scope.
- **Every prompt opens:** read CLAUDE.md, .ai/STANDARDS.md, relevant spec, and this file.
- **Every prompt closes:** php -l, php artisan view:clear, scripts/dev-check.ps1 if structural change, Tinker verification, **update this CHAT_STARTER.md**.
- **No hard deletes.** SoftDeletes only.
- **PPRA not EAAB. POPIA consent rules apply.**
- **Bug report = code is wrong.** Never blame caching or user error.

### 3.2 IN FLIGHT

- **Branch `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`** — MIC collision fix landed (A.3.4); Tonight: M22 test fix + universal-signature audit + Phase 9c investigation + three small fixes (419 / CMA logo / Tools logo) shipped on same branch.
- **Phase 9c — POPIA blockers** — investigation complete (2026-05-25). Findings: privacy policy page absent (no `/privacy` route, `agencies.popi_url` field exists but only rendered in email footer); Information Officer field NOT on `agencies` table (only `whistleblow_compliance_officer_email` free-text); agency PPRA number NOT on `agencies` (only `ffc_no` exists). Awaiting Johan's architectural decisions on per-agency vs system-wide privacy, IO as User FK vs free-text, PPRA scope (agency vs branch) before fix prompt.
- **Next:** Andre — Staging deploy + live DB pull after batch lands. Figure-matching audit on staging.

### 3.3 SPECCED / partial — not fully built

- **Universal signature feature** — Layer 1 (upload tab in signing modal) + Layer 2 (stored signature on user profile) specced March 2026. Build state unconfirmed pending audit. Vision: apply pre-fill to every signature capture surface (FICA ack, RMCP ack, training, deal step sign-off) where signatory is authenticated user.
- **Tenant pre-approval** (TVA integration)
- **Inspection reports module**
- **Statistics tile builder** ("See every number the way you want to see it")
- **Map A.4 / A.5 / A.6** — logo pins, viewport pagination, mode pills (Opportunities / Analyse / Seller / Buyer)
- **CoreGolf** — Johan's personal project, Huawei GT6 Pro ArkTS app
- **Module 4 (Buyer CRM) + Module 5 (Seller Live Link)** — calendar follow-on
- **Deal Register V2** — full spec written
- **Sales pipeline + Rental pipeline views**

### 3.4 PARKED / future

- **Phase 9e** — 6 audit M-fixes + 5 deferred 9d.2 items
- **System-wide back-nav audit**
- **User activity tracking spec**
- **4 strategic spec pillars** — compliance philosophy, integration philosophy, supplier partnership thesis, naming canon
- **Auto activity tracking + Exclusive auto-notification**
- **CDS importer path** — keep or retire? (decided: hand-crafted Blade is the path; CDS legacy support TBD)
- **Accounting module** — long-term Sage replacement

## 4. Recent decisions log (last 15, newest top)

- **2026-05-25** — CLAUDE.md tightened: subagents producing audit/report files MUST write to disk via file-write tools, not return content in chat only (response to tonight's universal-signature subagent that skipped the write step).
- **2026-05-25** — Tonight's batch: 419 redirect + CMA cert logo + Tools page logo all shipped on `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`. Agency `logo_path` is now the canonical logo source for Tools (wins over stale `PerformanceSetting.company_logo_url`).
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c investigation: privacy policy + Information Officer + agency PPRA number — findings reported, moved from PARKED to IN FLIGHT; awaiting architectural decisions before fix.
- **2026-05-25** — Universal signature audit completed; report at `.ai/audits/universal-signature-audit-2026-05-25.md`. Layers 1 + 2 both unbuilt. 8 capture surfaces total (3 authenticated, 4 token, 1 CO). Wire-up effort: M-size (~10 files); encryption at rest: S-size (independent).
- **2026-05-25** — `.ai/CHAT_STARTER.md` bootstrap landed; CLAUDE.md close-checklist now requires updating it every prompt.
- **2026-05-25** — Staging deploy after MIC collision fix; Andre handles deploy + live DB pull. Map + MIC walk on staging. Figure-matching audit on real data next.
- **2026-05-25** — 1 Aug live target locked. Weekly cadence: 26 May staging stable → 2 June bug-hunt week 1 (Cindy/Rochelle/Gerda/Shawn) → 9 June feature freeze → 16 June stability → 23 June PropCon notice decision → 30 June 30-day notice → 1 Aug live.
- **2026-05-25** — Demo stays separate (synthetic Uvongo data, midnight reseed). Staging is proving ground with live DB.
- **2026-05-25** — Workflow: lightweight verification per prompt, full M1-MN sweep + dev-check every 3rd prompt or on explicit ask.
- **2026-05-25** — Map modes locked: Opportunities / Analyse / Seller / Buyer (Opportunities + Analyse align with MIC tabs).
- **2026-05-25** — A.3 + A.2.7 + M22 test + MIC investigation landed.
- **2026-04-29** — Architecture: Claude owns template design centrally. Hand-crafted Blade with declarative metadata, bypass CDS UI. Templates 116/117/119 first under this model.
- **2026-04-22** — FICA module live deploy with corrections cycle, agent doc upload, auto-file to contact drive.
- **2026-03-21** — One-block-system-loops: template has one anchor per role, system renders N stacked signature blocks based on actual party count.
- **2026-03-21** — E-sign sales documents legally allowed electronically.

## 5. Outstanding small fixes (none blocking)

- _(none open as of 2026-05-25 — 419 / CMA logo / Tools logo all shipped tonight)_

## 6. Next likely move

Tonight's batch (M22, A.3.4, 419 + CMA + Tools logo, signature audit, 9c investigation) is landed on `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`. Next: (1) Johan approves Phase 9c scope (privacy + IO + PPRA) — then VS Code writes the fix prompt; (2) merge feature branch → Staging; (3) Andre pulls live DB, walks map + MIC + e-sign on staging; (4) figure-matching audit; (5) decide whether universal-signature pre-fill (Layer 2) makes the 1 Aug cut. Bug-hunt week from 2 June.
