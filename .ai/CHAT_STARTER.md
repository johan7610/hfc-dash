<!-- ============================================================ -->

## 1. Identity & Stack

**Who:** Johan Reichel (CEO, HFC). Andre Roets (full-stack dev). Two-person team building CoreX OS — real estate operating system. HFC (Home Finders Coastal) is the first live agency. Long-term vision: SA's leading real estate OS, replacing PropCon / Sage / Property24 layers across the industry.

**Stack:** Laravel 12 / Blade / Alpine.js. MySQL prod (`hfc_corex`, `hfc_staging`). SQLite local. Vite. Ubuntu on Hetzner `91.99.130.85`. Code at `/hfc` (live) and `/hfc-staging`. Python AI service `/opt/hf-ai/app.py` port 3100 (not in git).

**Domain:** `corex.hfcoastal.co.za` live. Staging on port 8084.

**Branches:** `main` (live), `Staging`, `HFC2402` (Johan dev), `andre` (Andre dev), feature branches off Staging. Discipline: HFC2402 + andre → Staging → staging server → main → live. Hotfix exception: direct to main, then back-sync to Staging.

**VS Code Claude** is the coding agent. Johan pastes prompts, it executes. Specs in `.ai/specs/`, read at start of every prompt.

## 2. Working Rules

- **Investigate before fixing.** Every issue: (1) audit, (2) Johan approves fix approach, (3) only then fix prompt. Never guess root causes.
- **One concern per prompt.** Two only if tightly related and same file.
- **Surgical changes.** No refactoring beyond scope.
- **Every prompt opens:** read CLAUDE.md, .ai/STANDARDS.md, relevant spec, and this file.
- **Every prompt closes:** php -l, php artisan view:clear, scripts/dev-check.ps1 if structural change, Tinker verification, **update this CHAT_STARTER.md**.
- **No hard deletes.** SoftDeletes only.
- **PPRA not EAAB. POPIA consent rules apply.**
- **Bug report = code is wrong.** Never blame caching or user error.

- **Universal signature feature** — Layer 1 (upload tab in signing modal) + Layer 2 (stored signature on user profile) specced March 2026. Build state unconfirmed pending audit.

- **User activity tracking spec**
- **4 strategic spec pillars** — compliance philosophy, integration philosophy, supplier partnership thesis, naming canon
- **Auto activity tracking + Exclusive auto-notification**
- **CDS importer path** — keep or retire? (decided: hand-crafted Blade is the path; CDS legacy support TBD)
- **Accounting module** — long-term Sage replacement

## 4. Recent decisions log (last 15, newest top)

- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-3 (Company Documents) shipped: `company_documents` table with token-based public `/legal/{token}` route mirrors `presentation_snapshot_links` pattern. Markdown content with admin live-preview editor. 6 curated types (privacy, T&Cs, complaints, AML, code of conduct, POPIA consent). Agency `privacy_policy_url` accessor cascades published doc → legacy `popi_url`. Phase 9c trilogy now LIVE.
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-2 (Information Officer) shipped: `information_officer_appointments` mirrors FICA pattern (primary + deputies, auto-end-old-primary). Admin UI under Compliance Settings, permission `manage_information_officer`, 5 lifecycle tests passing.
- **2026-05-25** — CDS template-creation investigation completed; report at `.ai/audits/cds-template-creation-investigation-2026-05-25.md`. 125 templates total (28 CDS, 3 hand-crafted, 22 importer, 72 legacy). 71% multi-tenant safe. April hand-crafted-Blade decision stands. Brief ready for tomorrow's joint session.
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c-1 (PPRA number) shipped: agencies + branches columns + settings UI + corex-document mislabel fix + agent-footer + RCR export. Branch-overrides-agency cascade verified via Tinker.
- **2026-05-25** — Presentations V2 phases 4–7 audit completed; report at `.ai/audits/presentations-v2-phases-4-7-audit-2026-05-25.md`. All four phases ✅ fully built; moved into section 3.1 LIVE. End-to-end "4-month-old link → banner → refresh request → agent notified" flow operational.
- **2026-05-25** — POPIA columns investigation completed; report at `.ai/audits/popia-columns-investigation-2026-05-25.md`. Conclusion: `ffc_no` ≠ PPRA reg number (legally distinct under PPA 22/2019). Phase 9c rename-vs-add decision = ADD new column.
- **2026-05-25** — CLAUDE.md tightened: subagents producing audit/report files MUST write to disk via file-write tools, not return content in chat only (response to tonight's universal-signature subagent that skipped the write step).
- **2026-05-25** — Tonight's batch: 419 redirect + CMA cert logo + Tools page logo all shipped on `feature/map-workspace-overhaul`. Agency `logo_path` is now the canonical logo source for Tools (wins over stale `PerformanceSetting.company_logo_url`).
- **2026-05-25** — Phase 9c investigation: privacy policy + Information Officer + agency PPRA number — findings reported, moved from PARKED to IN FLIGHT; awaiting architectural decisions before fix.
- **2026-05-25** — Universal signature audit completed; report at `.ai/audits/universal-signature-audit-2026-05-25.md`. Layers 1 + 2 both unbuilt. 8 capture surfaces total (3 authenticated, 4 token, 1 CO). Wire-up effort: M-size (~10 files); encryption at rest: S-size (independent).
- **2026-05-25** — `.ai/CHAT_STARTER.md` bootstrap landed; CLAUDE.md close-checklist now requires updating it every prompt.
- **2026-05-25** — Staging deploy after MIC collision fix; Andre handles deploy + live DB pull. Map + MIC walk on staging. Figure-matching audit on real data next.
- **2026-05-25** — 1 Aug live target locked. Weekly cadence: 26 May staging stable → 2 June bug-hunt week 1 (Cindy/Rochelle/Gerda/Shawn) → 9 June feature freeze → 16 June stability → 23 June PropCon notice decision → 30 June 30-day notice → 1 Aug live.
- **2026-05-25** — Demo stays separate (synthetic Uvongo data, midnight reseed). Staging is proving ground with live DB.
- **2026-04-29** — Architecture: Claude owns template design centrally. Hand-crafted Blade with declarative metadata, bypass CDS UI. Templates 116/117/119 first under this model.

## 5. Outstanding small fixes (none blocking)

- _(none open as of 2026-05-25 — 419 / CMA logo / Tools logo all shipped tonight)_

## 6. Next likely move

Branch `feature/map-workspace-overhaul` carries everything from tonight: A.3.4 MIC fix + M22 test + 419 + CMA + Tools logo + chat starter + 4 audit reports + **complete Phase 9c trilogy** (PPRA, Information Officer, Company Documents). All 9c POPIA blockers closed. Next when Johan returns: (1) populate HFC's PPRA numbers + appoint Elize as primary IO + draft+publish HFC privacy policy via Tinker; (2) tomorrow's CDS architecture session (brief at `.ai/audits/cds-template-creation-investigation-2026-05-25.md`); (3) merge feature branch → Staging; (4) Andre pulls live DB, walks map + MIC + e-sign + Phase 9c surfaces on staging; (5) figure-matching audit; (6) decide whether universal-signature pre-fill (Layer 2) makes the 1 Aug cut. Bug-hunt week from 2 June.
