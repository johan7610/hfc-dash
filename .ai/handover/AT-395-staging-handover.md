# AT-395 — Staging promotion handover

Prepared 2026-09-07, QA1 only. Nothing here has been pushed to Staging. Every line below was
verified directly against git and the running QA1 checkout at the time of writing — nothing is
from memory.

---

## 1. Branch and commits

**Branch:** `at395-hotfix-2026-09-07`
**Pushed to origin:** yes, confirmed — `origin/at395-hotfix-2026-09-07` == local branch tip
(`b4f3bb76d9cd7ff373118a865da0edf46a5ede6e`).

AT-395 is exactly **3 commits**, in order:

| # | Hash | One-line message |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 1 | `75cf670efbcd4be82b56e76edcf8ca21b7f52571` | feat(communications): AT-395 Phase A — send e-sign mail through the agency's own mailbox |
| 2 | `7cc7b33deb9ea9473ac8ec6da4f1c7da634f6103` | fix(esign): AT-395 real-send failures — missing To header + false-Sent audit/UI gaps |
| 3 | `b4f3bb76d9cd7ff373118a865da0edf46a5ede6e` | fix(esign): AT-395 second sweep — false-Sent bug class across the full advance chain |

**Uncommitted state:** nothing AT-395-related is uncommitted in the shared `/corex-qa1` checkout.
The checkout currently has other lanes' unrelated uncommitted/untracked files (reconstructed
migrations from an earlier DB-restore task, some `web-templates/cds/template-*.blade.php` files,
two `render_step3_*.mjs` scratch scripts, and pre-existing drift in `.ai/*.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) — none
of these touch any AT-395 file and none were created by this work.

**Cut from:** QA1 at commit `fa4a5ef79` (merge of `fix/esign-whatsapp-click-dead-2026-09-07`).
Commits 2 and 3 were then added directly, and the branch pointer was fast-forwarded to track
QA1's tip after each commit so the running QA1 site always had the fix live.

**Rebasing needed?** Not against QA1 — the branch is a clean linear descendant, currently sitting
2 commits behind QA1's live tip (QA1 has since taken on more unrelated work from other lanes; see
§3). **Against Staging, yes, sequencing matters** — see the critical note below.

**⚠️ This branch is NOT an isolated AT-395 diff.** Because QA1 has been a single shared trunk all
night, `at395-hotfix-2026-09-07` descends from — and therefore *contains* — everything already
merged into QA1 before 14:41 today, which is **77 commits**, not 3. That includes the WhatsApp
click-fix, the e-sign identity/reauth work, the e-sign identity-binding work, and a large amount of
`rental-applications` (AT-392) work. Verified: `git merge-base --is-ancestor 79a54fcf5
origin/Staging` → **NO**, and same for `eee164534` → **NO**. Neither the identity/reauth merge nor
the identity-binding merge is on `origin/Staging` yet. **If this branch is merged into Staging
as-is, all 77 commits land, not just the 3 AT-395 ones.** If the other chat wants AT-395 in
isolation, they should cherry-pick exactly `75cf670ef 7cc7b33de b4f3bb76d` onto Staging in that
order, not merge the branch wholesale. Given the brief says "promotion for ALL of tonight's work,"
this may be intended — flagging it so it's a decision, not a surprise.

---

## 2. The migration — the known trap

**File:** `database/migrations/2026_09_07_134131_add_outgoing_smtp_fields_to_communication_mailboxes_table.php`
**Class:** anonymous (`return new class extends Migration { ... }` — standard Laravel 9+ syntax,
no named class to reference).

**What it does — two tables:**
- `communication_mailboxes`: adds 15 new columns, all guarded by `Schema::hasColumn()` checks
  (idempotent, safe to run twice) — `outgoing_enabled` (bool, default false),
  `use_imap_credentials_for_smtp` (bool, default true), `smtp_host` (string, nullable),
  `smtp_port` (int, default 587), `smtp_encryption` (enum tls/ssl/none, default tls),
  `smtp_username` (string, nullable), `smtp_encrypted_password` (text, nullable),
  `smtp_from_name` (string, nullable), `outgoing_active` (bool, default true), `last_send_error`,
  `last_send_error_at`, `consecutive_send_failures` (default 0), `send_failure_notified_at`,
  `last_sent_at`, `last_sent_folder_append_error`, `last_sent_folder_append_at`.
- `agencies`: adds one column, `communication_send_failure_alert_threshold` (nullable unsigned
  smallint), also `hasColumn`-guarded.
- **Purely additive.** No existing column renamed, retyped, or dropped. No data transformation.

**Ordering — this is the trap, stated exactly:** the code in commit 1 (`75cf670ef`) reads
`outgoing_enabled` as a raw SQL `WHERE` clause (`CommunicationMailbox.php:128`,
`->where('outgoing_enabled', true)`) inside the mailbox-resolution path that runs on **every**
e-sign send attempt. Verified directly in the model. **If the code deploys before the migration
runs, this is not a soft failure or a silent fallback — it is a `QueryException: Unknown column
'outgoing_enabled'` thrown on every single e-sign send, immediately.** Run `php artisan migrate
--force` before restarting php-fpm/queue workers on the new code, in the standard CoreX deploy
order (CLAUDE.md §"How to Build Something New" step h): git pull → migrate --force → cache
clears → reload php-fpm → restart queue worker.

**Reversible?** Yes, cleanly — `down()` drops exactly the 16 columns it added, nothing else. Since
every new column is either nullable or has a default, and the columns aren't referenced by any
other migration or seeder, rolling back loses only whatever outgoing-mailbox configuration was
entered after the migration ran (mailbox rows themselves are untouched — they just lose these
columns). No IMAP-read/import functionality is affected by a rollback; that's on the pre-existing
columns this migration never touches.

**Conflicts with anything else landing tonight?** No collision found. Checked every migration file
in `origin/Staging..at395-hotfix-2026-09-07` (14 total): the other 13 are all
`rental_applications`/`rental_application_*` tables or `docuperfect_esign_settings` columns —
none touch `communication_mailboxes` or `agencies`. No filename-timestamp collision either
(`2026_09_07_134131` is unique in the migrations directory).

### Overlap with WhatsApp work

**None.** Checked the WhatsApp merge commits landing on QA1 tonight
(`fix/esign-whatsapp-click-dead-2026-09-07`, `fix/esign-whatsapp-followup-2026-09-07`,
`feature/esign-whatsapp-send`). Their files: `.ai/specs/esign-v3-complete-spec.md` and
`resources/views/docuperfect/signatures/partials/_whatsapp-resend-button.blade.php`. Neither
appears anywhere in the AT-395 file list above. No shared file, no risk.

### Overlap with the identity/ID-gate work — real, named collision

**Yes — three files, named exactly.** The `feature/esign-identity-and-reauth` merge (`79a54fcf5`,
already on QA1 since 05:29 today, i.e. it landed *before* AT-395 was built and AT-395 was built on
top of it) touched:

- `app/Http/Controllers/Docuperfect/ESignWizardController.php` — **also touched by AT-395 commit 3.**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Docuperfect/SignatureController.php` — **also touched by AT-395 commits 2 and 3.**
- `app/Services/Docuperfect/SignatureService.php` — **also touched by AT-395 commits 1, 2, and 3.**

(It also touched `AmendmentController.php`, `SigningController.php`,
`Concerns/EnforcesReauthorisationBinding.php`, `Contact.php`, `SignatureRequest.php`, two
migrations, and `wizard.blade.php` — none of those are shared with AT-395.)

**Risk assessment:** because AT-395 was built and both hotfix rounds were written *on top of*
this already-merged identity/reauth code (it is an ancestor of `at395-hotfix-2026-09-07`, verified
in §1), there is **no unresolved conflict inside this branch** — git already reconciled both sets
of changes when I built on top of QA1. The risk is only if the other chat's promotion plan applies
the identity/reauth code and the AT-395 code as two *separate, independently cherry-picked* units
rather than via this branch's actual linear history — in that scenario a textual merge conflict on
these 3 files is plausible, since both features made real, nearby edits inside them. Safest
sequencing: promote via the existing QA1 ancestry (this branch, or QA1 itself) rather than
re-deriving each feature as an isolated patch.

## 4. The identity gate — answered directly

**Did AT-395 touch `assertRecipientsHaveIdentityForSend` in any way?** **No.** Verified: the
function is defined once, at `app/Http/Controllers/Docuperfect/ESignWizardController.php:5297`,
and called at lines 2776, 7577 (plus referenced in a comment at 3693). `grep` for that function
name across all three AT-395 commit diffs returns zero matches. AT-395's one edit to
`ESignWizardController.php` (in commit 3, `b4f3bb76d`) is at line ~8129 — inside
`wetInkAgentApprove()`, a wet-ink upload-on-behalf approval action — nowhere near the identity
gate function or any of its three call sites.

**Did AT-395 touch the `EsignSettings` model, or any identity/reauth setting?** **No.** Verified:
`app/Models/Docuperfect/EsignSettings.php` does not appear in any of the three AT-395 commits'
file lists (checked via `git show --stat` on each). AT-395 never reads or writes
`requireIdentityBeforeSend`, `strictReauthorisationBinding`, or any other `EsignSettings` field.

**Could anything AT-395 changed cause the identity gate to reappear, become conditional, or be
bypassed?** **No, plainly.** AT-395 is entirely about *how* an already-approved-to-send invitation
email is transported (which SMTP server it goes out through, and whether a copy lands in the
sender's own Sent folder) — it sits strictly downstream of `assertRecipientsHaveIdentityForSend()`
in the call chain and never touches the settings table that gate reads. The one place AT-395
changed *when* an email attempt happens (the false-Sent sweep in commit 3) only changes whether a
send that already passed every prior gate is honestly reported as sent-or-failed after the
attempt — it adds no new path around the gate and removes none of the existing ones. The other
chat's own re-check of the gate being unconditional after landing should find it byte-identical
to before AT-395, since no AT-395 diff touches that file or that settings model at all.

---

## 5. Manual configuration required on Staging after the merge

**Outgoing mailbox settings are per-environment data, not code.** They live in individual rows of
the `communication_mailboxes` table (per agent/mailbox), which do **not** travel with a code
deploy or a migration (the migration only adds the columns — it does not populate them). **No
e-sign invitation will go out through an agency's own mailbox on Staging until someone configures
at least one mailbox there with real outgoing settings and a working password.** Until that
happens, `resolveOutgoingMailboxFor()` finds no `outgoing_enabled=true` row for the sending agent
and the send silently uses the pre-existing shared CoreX mailer exactly as it did before AT-395 —
this is the designed no-mailbox fallback, not a bug, but it means AT-395's actual improvement
(Gmail SPF/DKIM pass) will not be observable on Staging until configured.

**Exactly what to enter, and where — verified against the actual form fields, not assumed:**

Only **one** of the two mailbox-management screens actually renders the outgoing/SMTP fields —
confirmed by grepping both view directories. Use:

- **Compliance → Communications → "Email Mailboxes (import)"** (`compliance.comm-mailboxes.*`,
  requires the `manage_communication_mailboxes` permission). Edit an existing mailbox row (or
  create one) and fill in, exactly as named in the form:
  - Checkbox `outgoing_enabled` — turn outgoing sending ON for this mailbox.
  - Checkbox `use_imap_credentials_for_smtp` — checked by default; if the mailbox's existing IMAP
    credentials are also valid for SMTP (usually true for a normal mailbox account), leave it
    checked and the SMTP host/port/username/password fields below can stay blank. Uncheck only if
    SMTP needs different credentials/host than IMAP.
  - If unchecked: `smtp_host`, `smtp_port` (defaults 587), `smtp_encryption` (tls/ssl/none,
    defaults tls), `smtp_username`, `smtp_password` (write-only, stored encrypted).
  - `smtp_from_name` — optional, defaults to the mailbox's user's name if left blank.
  - Use the **Test Connection** button on this same screen after saving — it exercises both the
    SMTP send leg and the IMAP Sent-folder-append leg independently and reports each separately.

  **Note the gap found while preparing this handover:** the *other* mailbox screen — **Settings →
  Email → "Email Capture Setup"** (`settings.email-setup.*`, the self-service per-user page) —
  has full backend support for these same fields in `EmailSetupController.php` (validation,
  store/update logic, Test Connection), but its Blade views
  (`resources/views/settings/email-setup/index.blade.php` and `_user-mailbox.blade.php`) render
  **no outgoing/SMTP form fields at all** — confirmed by grep, zero hits for "outgoing" or "smtp"
  in either file. An agent using that self-service page cannot currently turn on outgoing sending
  for their own mailbox through the UI; only the admin-facing Communications screen exposes it.
  This is a pre-existing gap in the AT-395 build (not something this handover's hotfix rounds
  touched), noted here so nobody spends time hunting for a control that isn't rendered on that
  particular page.

**Mail config differences — QA1 vs Staging:**

QA1's `.env` (verified directly): `MAIL_MAILER=smtp`, `MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `MAIL_PORT=1025`
(a local catch-all, not a real server), `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=system@hfcoastal.co.za`. This is why,
*before* any mailbox is configured for outgoing, e-sign mail on QA1 goes to a local catcher, not a
real inbox — and why configuring a real per-mailbox SMTP row (as was done for
`johan@hfcoastal.co.za` during testing) was necessary to prove real delivery at all.

**I cannot verify Staging's actual current `.env` mail values from this QA1 checkout** — this
session has no filesystem access to the Staging host, and the only documents found in `.ai/`
referencing Staging mail config are a June 2026 deploy-checklist template (with a placeholder
`MAIL_HOST=...`, not a real value) and an August 2026 investigation of a *different* box
(`live-testing`, a separate physical/DNS environment, not the `Staging` git branch's own target).
Neither is a reliable source for Staging's mail config **today**. **The other chat should check
Staging's actual `.env` directly before assuming its default-mailer behaviour** — if it currently
points at a real SMTP server (rather than a local catcher like QA1), any e-sign send from an agent
with no mailbox configured will go out for real through whatever `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` Staging uses,
exactly as it did before AT-395 existed. AT-395 does not change that fallback path at all.

**Other environment-specific steps after deploy** (standard CoreX deploy order, CLAUDE.md
step h): `php artisan migrate --force`, then `view:clear`, `route:clear`, `config:clear`, reload
php-fpm, restart the queue worker. No new queue is introduced by AT-395 — sends happen
synchronously in the request/controller flow, same as before. The one new permission key
(`communication_mailboxes.view`, added to `config/corex-permissions.php`) is config-driven, not
DB-seeded — no `permissions:sync`-type command was found in this codebase for it; a plain
`config:clear` after deploy is what makes it visible, consistent with how the rest of
`corex-permissions.php` already works.

---

## 6. What to test on Staging, in order — shortest path to proving it works

1. Confirm the migration ran: `communication_mailboxes` has the new columns (e.g.
   `php artisan tinker` → `Schema::hasColumn('communication_mailboxes','outgoing_enabled')` →
   `true`).
2. Configure one real mailbox for outgoing (§5) and click **Test Connection** on the Communications
   → Email Mailboxes screen. Both legs (SMTP send, IMAP Sent-folder append) should report success
   independently.
3. Send a real e-sign invitation from an agent whose mailbox was just configured, to a real test
   inbox. Confirm `invite_send_status = sent` on the resulting `signature_requests` row and
   `sent_at` is stamped.
4. Confirm the email actually arrived at the test inbox, and that a copy appears in that mailbox's
   own real Sent folder (not just the CoreX database).
5. Deliberately break the mailbox (wrong password, or disable `outgoing_active`) and attempt
   another send. Confirm it fails **loudly**: `invite_send_status = failed`, the request is never
   marked sent, and the error is genuinely visible on the My E-Sign Documents screen (this was the
   exact defect class AT-395's two hotfix commits fixed on QA1 — worth re-proving fresh on
   Staging rather than assuming it carries over).
6. Test **Resend** from My E-Sign Documents against both a healthy and a broken mailbox — confirm
   each shows the correct outcome.
7. Only after 1–6 pass: check an agent with **no** mailbox configured still sends via the
   pre-existing shared mailer exactly as before (the no-mailbox fallback must be unaffected).

---

## 7. Known limitations carried into Staging

- **Phase B (OAuth-based mailbox auth) is not built.** Only static SMTP host/port/username/password
  is supported in Phase A. This was always out of scope for AT-395 Phase A — not a regression.
- **The self-service "Email Capture Setup" page cannot configure outgoing settings** (§5) — the
  backend supports it, the view does not render the fields. Pre-existing gap in the original
  build, not touched by either hotfix round.
- **One narrow instance of the false-Sent bug class was found but deliberately left unfixed,
  and reported rather than rushed:** `SignatureService::submitInspection()` (the wet-ink *physical*
  document inspection/decision flow, distinct from the digital invitation flow that was the actual
  reported and reproduced Staging-bound bug) has the same shape — a discarded advance result — but
  its return type is a different model (`WetInkInspection`) that can't carry the outcome without a
  larger return-shape change. Full detail in spec §15.5. Do not treat this as a new bug if found —
  it's a known, named, already-scoped gap.
- **SPF/DKIM verification was done by Johan directly in Gmail** ("Show original" → SPF PASS, DKIM
  PASS) for the QA1 test send. This session had no way to check headers itself and did not
  re-verify SPF/DKIM as part of this handover — that check is specific to the sending domain's DNS
  records (SPF/DKIM are configured at the domain/DNS level, not per-environment code), so it
  should hold on Staging too provided Staging sends through the same real mailbox/domain, but this
  has not been independently re-tested on Staging and should be per §6 step 4.
- **All 9 regression tests pass** (`tests/Feature/Communications/OutgoingMailPerMailboxTest.php`),
  but per CLAUDE.md Rule 13 the full suite was never run this session (single most relevant file
  only, per standing instruction) — the other chat's own promotion checks should decide whether a
  broader suite run is warranted before Staging goes live with this.
