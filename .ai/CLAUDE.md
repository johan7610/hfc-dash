# ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE OPERATING RULES — READ FIRST, EVERY COMMAND, NO EXCEPTIONS

These override everything else. Violating scope is worse than doing nothing. When in doubt: STOP and report.

1. SCOPE LOCK. Work ONLY on the exact task in the current instruction. Do not touch, edit, refactor, rename, reformat, "improve," clean up, or fix ANY file, feature, module, or behaviour outside that exact task — not even if it looks broken, related, or trivial, and not even if you are "already in the file."

2. NO AUTO-FIX / REPORT-ONLY OUTSIDE SCOPE. If you find a bug, regression, or issue anywhere outside your exact task, STOP and REPORT it to the conductor with exact file:line + root cause. Do NOT change it. Nothing outside the assigned task is changed without Johan's strict, specific, explicit instruction.

3. SPEC-EXACT, NO IMPROVISING. Build strictly to the instruction and the named .ai/specs/ spec. Add NOTHING that was not explicitly asked for — no extra features, fields, pages, UI, or behaviour. If the instruction and the spec conflict, or anything is ambiguous, STOP and ask the conductor. Never guess. Never interpret. Never assume.

4. STAY IN YOUR LANE. Work only in your assigned module. Never wander into another part of CoreX for any reason.

5. QA1 ONLY — JOHAN GATES EVERYTHING. All work lands on QA1 and STAYS there. NEVER promote to Staging or live. Flow: QA1 -> Johan tests on QA1 -> Johan's explicit go -> Staging -> live. No live work of any kind (code OR data) without Johan's specific explicit order for that exact action.

6. NO SILENT EXTRAS. No speculative changes, no "while I was here," no drive-by refactors, no dependency bumps, no formatting sweeps, no touching unrelated files.

7. REPORT EXACTLY. When done, report exactly what changed (files + why) and how you proved it, and confirm nothing outside the task was touched.

8. FULL CRUD, LIST-SCREEN COMPLETENESS, AND OWN/BRANCH/AGENCY SCOPING ARE THE FLOOR — DESIGNED IN, NOT REQUESTED. Johan's words: "we always need proper crud? search / sort / own / branch / agency levels. that should be the design standard. not me asking for it once we get to that stage." Every entity ships with Create, Read, Update, Archive (soft delete only — never hard delete) and Restore from the first build, not as a later ask. Every list screen ships with search (named fields), sort (every sensible column + a stated default), filter (status + date range minimum), pagination, and a real empty state. Every list, detail view, export, download, and API endpoint enforces OWN / BRANCH / AGENCY visibility scoping at the query layer (BelongsToAgency / AgencyScope, never a hidden UI link) — direct-URL access by ID is blocked, not just unlinked. The spec for any new feature states search fields, sort/default, filters, and per-screen scoping BEFORE code is written; a spec missing these is not ready to build. Full detail: BUILD_STANDARD.md §1a.

This applies to the conductor too.

# CoreX OS — Claude Instructions
> **Root entry point. Read this first. Every session. No exceptions.**

## What is CoreX OS

CoreX OS is the all-in-one operating system for Home Finders Coastal — a real estate agency on the KZN South Coast, South Africa. It is not a feature-rich website. It is a **real estate operating system** built on four core pillars that every module connects to.

This is a production system used by real agents, managing real deals, real money, and real compliance obligations. There is no "good enough for now." Everything ships production-ready.

---

## MANDATORY: Session Start Protocol

Before touching a single line of code, every session — Johan's or Andre's — must follow this sequence:

```
1. Read /.ai/SYSTEM.md          — pillars, architecture, data model, non-negotiables
2. Read /.ai/STANDARDS.md       — UX rules, execution rules, done criteria
3. Read /.ai/CODEBASE_MAP.md    — file paths, patterns, common gotchas
4. Find the relevant spec in /.ai/specs/[module].md
5. If no spec exists → STOP. Create the spec first. Get approval. Then build.
6. If the feature touches multiple modules → confirm pillar connections before starting.
```

**There is no step 0 that skips this.**

---

## The Four Pillars

Every module in CoreX OS reads from and writes back to at least one of these:

| Pillar | Model | What it represents |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Property** | `Property` | The physical asset — address, type, valuation, history |
| **Contact** | `Contact` | Any person — owner, buyer, tenant, landlord, seller |
| **Deal** | `Deal` | Any transaction — sale, rental, mandate, offer |
| **Agent** | `User` (agent role) | The practitioner — FFC, commission, performance |

**If a module cannot read from its relevant pillars and write enriched data back — it is not done.**

---

## Spec-First Rule

**No spec = no code. This is non-negotiable.**

A spec must exist in `/.ai/specs/[module].md` before any development begins on that module or feature.

### Who writes specs
Either Johan or Andre can draft a spec. The other party reviews it. Both must be aligned before dev starts. Johan commits approved specs to `main`.

### What a spec must contain
- What this feature does and why (business requirement)
- Which pillars it connects to, reads from, writes back to
- Data model / migrations needed
- UI placement and navigation entry
- User flow (step by step)
- Permissions required
- Acceptance criteria — how we know it's done and working
- Files to create or modify

### Spec sync rule
The `/.ai/` folder is the single source of truth. Spec changes are committed to `main` only. Before starting any dev session, pull the latest specs:
```bash
git pull origin main -- .ai/
```
Both Johan (HFC2402) and Andre (andre) always develop against the same approved specs.

---

## Non-Negotiables

These rules are not open for discussion. They apply to every line of code written on this project:

### 1. No hard deletes. Ever.
All "delete" actions are soft deletes (`deleted_at` via Laravel SoftDeletes). The user sees a Delete button. The system archives. Admin can recover. No exceptions — not for documents, deals, contacts, templates, users, or any other model.

### 2. Every new page gets a navigation entry on the same day.
A page without a navigation link does not exist to the user. Sidebar, menu, or button — it must exist. This is built as part of the feature, not added later.

### 3. Spec before code.
Described above. No exceptions.

### 4. Pillars are the spine.
New features connect to the pillars. They do not become new islands. If a feature doesn't connect to at least one pillar, the spec is incomplete.

### 5. Permissions are mandatory.
Every new feature includes permission keys in `CoreXPermissionSeeder.php`, sidebar gating, route middleware, and controller checks. If permissions aren't in, the feature isn't done.

### 6. Production quality only.
No demo modes. No "we'll fix it later." No patches over root causes. If it works, it works correctly. If it doesn't, fix the root cause.

### 7. Multi-tenancy is non-negotiable.
Every tenant-owned table has an `agency_id` column and every tenant-owned model
uses `App\Models\Concerns\BelongsToAgency`. A user of Agency A must never read
or write Agency B data — enforced structurally by the global `AgencyScope`,
not by ad-hoc `where('agency_id', …)` in controllers. New pillar tables ship
with `agency_id` from day one. Full spec: `.ai/specs/multi-tenancy.md`. Do
not use `withoutGlobalScope(AgencyScope::class)` in request code.

### 8. Branch rules.
- `main` = production server (91.99.130.85)
- `HFC2402` = Johan's dev branch
- `andre` = Andre's dev branch
- Hotfixes only go directly to main. Everything else: dev branch → reviewed → merged to main.
- Always check for the other person's commits before merging to main.
- Never push `database.sqlite` — this file must be in `.gitignore`.

## How to Build Something New

```
1. Is there a spec?
   YES → read it, confirm pillars, build
   NO  → write the spec, get approval, commit to main, then build

2. Before writing any code:
   - Find existing code that does something similar
   - Read CODEBASE_MAP.md for exact file paths
   - Use the INVESTIGATE → COPY → ADAPT pattern
   - Never build from scratch when a working pattern exists

3. One concern per prompt.
   Tightly related changes in the same file = together.
   Everything else = separate prompts, tested one at a time.

4. Before declaring done:
   - php artisan view:clear
   - php artisan route:clear
   - php artisan cache:clear
   - php -l on all changed PHP files
   - scripts/dev-check.ps1 (894 tests, 2236 assertions)
   - Verify the feature works end-to-end, not just "no errors"
```

---

## How to Fix a Bug

```
1. Get the exact error message and the URL it happens on
2. Read the stack trace — find the actual file and line number
3. Read DIAG_CHECKLIST_UI.md if it's a page showing 0 or blank
4. Fix the root cause, not the symptom
5. php -l on changed files
6. Test the fix
7. Run dev-check.ps1
```

## Golden Rule

> We do complicated so the user can do simple.
> Over-engineer for correctness. Fix root causes, not symptoms.
> No patches. No quick fixes. No "later."
> **Later doesn't exist.**
