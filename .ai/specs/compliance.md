# Spec: Compliance

**Status:** Partially implemented across modules — needs centralisation

---

## SA Compliance Context

CoreX operates under South African property law. Compliance in this context means:

| Framework | Applies To |
|-----------|-----------|
| **PPRA** (Property Practitioners Regulatory Authority) | Agent licensing — FFC per agent |
| **FICA** (Financial Intelligence Centre Act) | KYC on all parties — buyer, seller, landlord, tenant |
| **POPIA** (Protection of Personal Information Act) | Data consent on every contact |
| **CPA** (Consumer Protection Act) | Disclosure obligations in mandates and offers |
| **Property Practitioners Act 22 of 2019** | Overarching legislation governing all practitioners |

## Current State

Compliance is currently scattered:
- FICA checklist items referenced in documents but not tracked as a status
- No central compliance dashboard
- Agent FFC status not surfaced in the system
- POPIA consent not captured at contact level

---
