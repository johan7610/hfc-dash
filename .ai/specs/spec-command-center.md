# CoreX Command Center — Design Spec
> The operational heartbeat of CoreX OS
> Version: 1.0 — 2026-03-31
> Status: DRAFT — requires approval before build

## What This Is

The Command Center is the **dashboard home screen** of CoreX OS — replacing the current minimal dashboard with a full operations hub. Think Monday.com's work management + a real estate-aware calendar + automated compliance tracking + property health monitoring + agent accountability — all wired into the four pillars.

This is not a standalone module. It is the **lens through which every agent, BM, and admin sees the state of their business** the moment they log in.

### Why This Matters
Right now, agents log in and see activity points. That's it. They don't know:
- Which properties haven't had any activity in 2 weeks
- Which documents are overdue for upload
- Which deals are stuck at a pipeline step
- Which leases expire in the next 90 days
- Which FICA submissions are incomplete
- What they need to do today vs this week vs this month

The Command Center answers all of these questions automatically, without the agent lifting a finger.

## Pillar Connections

| Pillar | Reads From | Writes Back |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Property** | Address, status, listing date, last activity, agent, documents, syndication status | Property health score, neglect flags, attention alerts |
| **Contact** | FICA status, linked properties, linked deals, document signing status | Compliance reminders, follow-up tasks |
| **Deal** | Pipeline step, dates (bond deadline, transfer, registration), commission status, parties | Deal health score, deadline events, overdue flags |
| **Agent** | FFC expiry, training status, assigned properties, assigned deals, daily activity | Agent scorecard, accountability metrics, workload distribution |

---

## Part 1: Calendar System

> Inherits from the existing `spec-calendar-module.md` — that spec covers the calendar in detail. This section adds what the calendar spec doesn't cover.

### Calendar Summary (from existing spec)
- `calendar_events` table with polymorphic source links
- Auto-generated events from Deals, Leases, Compliance, Documents, Prospecting
- Manual event creation
- Month/Week/Day/Agenda/Timeline views
- Reminder engine with escalation chains
- iCal subscription for phone sync
- In-app + email notifications

### Additions Beyond Calendar Spec

#### 1. Event Categories (expanded)
The calendar spec covers deal/lease/compliance/document/prospecting events. Add:

| Category | Trigger | Events Created |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Property Health** | Property idle > X days (configurable) | "Property Needs Attention: [address]" |
| **Document Expectations** | Property created with listing type | "Upload Mandate: [property]" due in 48h |
| **Showday Followup** | Showday registered on property | "Showday Follow-up: [property]" at +24h |
| **Contact Followup** | New contact created (buyer/tenant type) | "Follow-up: [contact name]" at +48h |
| **Agent Onboarding** | New agent added | "Complete Onboarding: [agent]" checklist events |
| **Trust Interest** | Monthly recurring | "Capture Trust Interest" on 1st of each month |
| **Branch Meeting** | Recurring per branch | "Branch Meeting: [branch]" weekly/monthly |

#### 2. Smart Scheduling
When creating manual events:
- **Conflict detection** — warn if the agent already has an event at that time
- **Travel time awareness** — if two viewings are in different suburbs, suggest buffer time
- **Working hours respect** — default events to business hours, flag after-hours

#### 3. Shared Calendars
- BMs see their branch's full calendar (all agents)
- Admins see all branches
- Agents see only their own (unless granted branch/all scope via permissions)
- Property calendars — view all events for a specific property across all agents

---

## Part 2: Task Board (Kanban)

This is the actionable counterpart to the calendar. Calendar shows **when**. Task board shows **what needs doing**.

### Task Structure
```
command_tasks table:
  id                  bigint PK
  title               string 255
  description         text nullable
  task_type           string (document_upload, follow_up, compliance, review, custom)
  status              enum: todo, in_progress, awaiting, done, dismissed
  priority            enum: low, normal, high, critical
  
  -- Assignment
  assigned_to         foreignId → users
  assigned_by         foreignId → users nullable (null = system-generated)
  
  -- Dates
  due_date            datetime nullable
  started_at          datetime nullable
  completed_at        datetime nullable
  
  -- Pillar links
  property_id         foreignId nullable
  contact_id          foreignId nullable
  deal_id             foreignId nullable (deals_v2)
  
  -- Source (what created this task)
  source_type         string nullable (automation_rule, manual, calendar_event)
  source_id           bigint nullable
  calendar_event_id   foreignId nullable (links task to calendar event)
  
  -- Tracking
  checklist           json nullable (sub-items with done/not-done)
  notes               text nullable
  
  -- Metadata
  metadata            json nullable
  branch_id           foreignId nullable
  agency_id           foreignId nullable
  created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
```

```

- Drag-and-drop between columns (Alpine.js)
- Cards show: title, linked entity, priority badge, due date, assigned agent avatar
- Filter by: agent, property, deal, priority, task type
- Click card → slide-out panel with full details

#### List View
- Table format with sorting/filtering
- Bulk actions: assign, change priority, mark done
- Group by: agent, property, due date, type

#### My Tasks (Agent View)
- Personal task list — only tasks assigned to the logged-in agent
- Sorted by priority then due date
- Quick-complete checkboxes for simple tasks

### Task Completion → Pillar Write-back
When a task is marked done:
- If it's a `document_upload` task → check if the document was actually uploaded to `property_files`. If yes, auto-complete. If no, ask for confirmation.
- If it's a `compliance` task → check the relevant compliance record. Auto-verify where possible.
- If it's a `follow_up` task → log a contact activity note.

---

## Part 3: Automation Engine

This is the brain. It watches what happens in CoreX and automatically creates calendar events and tasks based on configurable rules.

### Rule Structure
```
automation_rules table:
  id                  bigint PK
  name                string 255
  description         text nullable
  is_active           boolean default true
  is_system           boolean default false (system rules can't be deleted, only deactivated)
  
  -- Trigger
  trigger_model       string (Property, Contact, Deal, DealV2, User, Lease, etc.)
  trigger_event       string (created, updated, status_changed, date_approaching, idle)
  trigger_conditions  json nullable
  -- Example conditions:
  -- { "field": "listing_type", "operator": "=", "value": "sale" }
  -- { "field": "status", "operator": "changed_to", "value": "under_offer" }
  -- { "field": "last_activity_at", "operator": "older_than", "value": "14 days" }
  
  -- Action
  action_type         string (create_event, create_task, send_notification, create_event_and_task)
  action_config       json
  -- Example config for create_task:
  -- {
  --   "title_template": "Upload Mandate for {property.address}",
  --   "task_type": "document_upload",
  --   "priority": "high",
  --   "due_offset": "+48h",
  --   "assign_to": "property.agent",
  --   "checklist": ["Signed mandate", "ID copy of owner", "Proof of ownership"]
  -- }
  
  -- Example config for create_event:
  -- {
  --   "title_template": "Bond Deadline: {property.address}",
  --   "event_type": "deal",
  --   "category": "bond_deadline",
  --   "date_field": "bond_approval_deadline",
  --   "reminder_offsets": [20160, 10080, 4320, 1440],
  --   "priority": "critical"
  -- }
  
  -- Scope
  agency_id           foreignId nullable (null = global/all agencies)
  branch_id           foreignId nullable (null = all branches)
  
  sort_order          integer default 0
  created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
```

### Built-In System Rules (ship active, admin can deactivate)

| # | Rule Name | Trigger | Action |
|---|-----------|---------|--------|

| 12 | **Offer Accepted → Transfer Checklist** | Deal status changed to "accepted" | Tasks: Transfer attorney, compliance docs, rates clearance |
| 13 | **Signing Overdue > 48h** | SignatureRequest pending > 48h | Task: "Chase signature from [party]" + escalation |

| 20 | **Commission Unpaid > 30 Days** | Deal registered > 30d, commission_status = 'Not Paid' | Task: "Follow up unpaid commission" + escalate to admin |

### Custom Rule Builder (Admin UI)
Admin can create custom rules via a form:
1. Pick a trigger model (Property, Contact, Deal, User, Lease)
2. Pick a trigger event (created, updated, field changed, date approaching, idle)
3. Set conditions (optional filters)
4. Pick an action (create event, create task, both, send notification)
5. Configure the action (title template, priority, due date offset, assignment, checklist)
6. Save and activate

### Automation Log
```
automation_log table:
  id                  bigint PK
  rule_id             foreignId → automation_rules
  trigger_model_type  string
  trigger_model_id    bigint
  action_type         string
  action_result_type  string nullable (CalendarEvent, CommandTask)
  action_result_id    bigint nullable
  executed_at         datetime
  success             boolean
  error_message       text nullable
  created_at
```

Every rule execution is logged. Admin can see: "Rule #7 fired 42 times this month, created 42 tasks, 38 completed, 4 overdue."

---

## Part 4: Property Health Monitor

Every property gets a computed **health score** based on configurable criteria. This surfaces neglected properties before they become problems.

### Health Factors (configurable weights in Settings)
| Factor | Measurement | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Last activity** | Days since any logged activity | Score drops after 7d, critical after 21d |
| **Documents complete** | Expected docs uploaded vs missing | Major penalty for missing mandate/FICA |
| **Photos** | Number of listing photos | Penalty below 10, bonus above 20 |
| **Syndication** | Active on P24/PP or not | Penalty if listing-ready but not syndicated |
| **Price currency** | Days since last price change | Neutral first 30d, penalty after 60d |
| **Enquiries** | Showday/viewing activity | Bonus for activity, penalty for none in 30d |
| **Contact links** | Owner/landlord linked with full details | Penalty if no owner contact linked |
| **Agent assigned** | Has an active assigned agent | Critical penalty if unassigned |

### Health Score Display
```
Property Health Score: 72/100  ████████████████████░░░░░  NEEDS ATTENTION

 ✓ Documents complete (3/3)
 ✓ Photos sufficient (18)
 ✗ No activity in 16 days          ← -15 points
 ✗ Not syndicated on P24           ← -8 points
 ✗ No viewing in 30 days           ← -5 points
```

### Property Health Table
```
property_health_scores table:
  id                  bigint PK
  property_id         foreignId unique
  score               integer (0-100)
  grade               enum: excellent (90+), good (70-89), attention (50-69), critical (<50)
  factors             json (breakdown of each factor's contribution)
  last_calculated_at  datetime
  created_at, updated_at
```

Recalculated by a scheduled command: `php artisan command-center:calculate-health` (runs nightly or on-demand).

## Part 5: Agent Scorecard

Each agent gets a real-time accountability scorecard — visible to the agent (their own) and to BMs/admins (all agents).

### Scorecard Metrics
| Metric | Source | Display |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Tasks completed this week** | command_tasks (done this week) | 12/15 (80%) |
| **Tasks overdue** | command_tasks (overdue count) | 3 overdue |
| **Properties attended** | Properties with activity in last 7d | 8/12 (67%) |
| **Documents uploaded** | property_files created this week | 5 |
| **FICA completion rate** | Contacts with complete vs incomplete FICA | 85% |
| **Average response time** | Time from task created to started | 4.2 hours |
| **Deals progressed** | Deal steps moved forward this week | 3 steps |
| **Calendar events completed** | Events marked done vs total due | 90% |
| **Activity points** | From existing daily activity system | 245 pts |

### Scorecard Views
- **Agent sees**: Their own scorecard on the dashboard — motivational, shows progress
- **BM sees**: All agents in their branch — comparison view, identify who needs support
- **Admin sees**: All agents, all branches — full oversight with drill-down

### Agent Scorecard Table (Computed)
```
agent_scorecards table:
  id                  bigint PK
  user_id             foreignId
  period_type         enum: daily, weekly, monthly
  period_start        date
  period_end          date
  
  tasks_completed     integer
  tasks_overdue       integer
  tasks_total         integer
  properties_attended integer
  properties_total    integer
  documents_uploaded  integer
  fica_complete       integer
  fica_total          integer
  avg_response_hours  decimal(8,2)
  deals_progressed    integer
  events_completed    integer
  events_total        integer
  activity_points     integer
  
  overall_score       integer (0-100)
  
  computed_at         datetime
  created_at, updated_at
```

---

## Part 6: Notification System

### Unified Notification Queue
```
notifications table (Laravel built-in):
  id                  uuid PK
  type                string (class name)
  notifiable_type     string (User)
  notifiable_id       bigint
  data                json (title, body, action_url, icon, category)
  read_at             datetime nullable
  created_at
```

Uses Laravel's built-in notification system with custom channels.

### Notification UI
- **Bell icon** in the CoreX header bar — shows unread count badge
- Click bell → dropdown panel with recent notifications
- Each notification shows: icon, title, time ago, action link
- "Mark all read" + "View all" links
- Notification categories: calendar, task, compliance, deal, property, system

### Notification Channels
| Channel | When | Implementation |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **In-app** | Always | Laravel notification + Alpine.js polling or Pusher |
| **Email** | Configurable per user | Laravel mail notification with branded template |
| **iCal** | Calendar events only | ICS feed endpoint per user |
| **Daily Digest** | Configurable | Scheduled command compiles day's summary into one email |

## Part 7: Dashboard Layout

The Command Center replaces the current dashboard. It is responsive and role-aware.

### Agent Dashboard

### Admin Dashboard (adds to BM view)
- Cross-branch comparison
- Agency-wide compliance overview
- Automation rule performance stats
- System health (rules fired, tasks auto-created, completion rates)

---

## Part 8: Settings

All configurable via Settings → Command Center:

### General Settings
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Property idle threshold (days) | 14 | Days before a property is flagged |
| Property critical threshold (days) | 30 | Days before property flagged as critical |
| Default task due offset | 48h | Default due date for auto-generated tasks |
| Scorecard calculation frequency | daily | How often agent scorecards recalculate |
| Health score calculation frequency | nightly | How often property health recalculates |

### Document Expectations
Admin defines what documents are expected per property type:
```
command_document_expectations table:
  id                  bigint PK
  property_type       string (sale, rental, commercial, vacant_land)
  document_type_id    foreignId → document_types
  required            boolean default true
  due_offset_hours    integer default 72
  label               string ("Signed Mandate", "Owner ID Copy", etc.)
  sort_order          integer
  agency_id           foreignId nullable
  created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
```

When a property is created, the system checks this table and auto-creates tasks for each expected document.

### Reminder Defaults (per event category)
```
command_reminder_defaults table:
  id                  bigint PK
  event_category      string (bond_deadline, lease_expiry, fica, mandate, etc.)
  reminder_offsets    json ([129600, 60480, 10080, 1440] — in minutes)
  escalation_enabled  boolean default true
  escalation_delay    integer default 1440 (minutes before escalating)
  escalation_to       string (bm, admin, both)
  agency_id           foreignId nullable
  created_at, updated_at
```

---

## Database Summary

### New Tables
| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `calendar_events` | All calendar events (auto + manual) | 10k+ |
| `calendar_reminders_log` | Reminder delivery audit trail | 50k+ |
| `calendar_user_preferences` | Per-user calendar settings | ~30 |
| `command_tasks` | Actionable task items | 5k+ |

## Permissions

Add to `config/corex-permissions.php`:

```php
// Command Center
'command_center.view'              => 'View Command Center dashboard',
'command_center.calendar.view'     => 'View calendar',
'command_center.calendar.create'   => 'Create manual calendar events',
'command_center.calendar.edit'     => 'Edit calendar events',
'command_center.calendar.delete'   => 'Delete calendar events',
'command_center.tasks.view'        => 'View task board',
'command_center.tasks.create'      => 'Create tasks',
'command_center.tasks.edit'        => 'Edit tasks',
'command_center.tasks.assign'      => 'Assign tasks to other agents',
'command_center.tasks.delete'      => 'Delete tasks',
'command_center.health.view'       => 'View property health scores',
'command_center.scorecards.view_own'    => 'View own scorecard',
'command_center.scorecards.view_branch' => 'View branch scorecards',
'command_center.scorecards.view_all'    => 'View all scorecards',
'command_center.automation.view'   => 'View automation rules',
'command_center.automation.manage' => 'Create/edit/delete automation rules',
'command_center.settings'          => 'Manage Command Center settings',
```

Data scoping follows the standard CoreX pattern:
- `own` scope → agent sees their events, tasks, properties, scorecard
- `branch` scope → BM sees the full branch
- `all` scope → admin sees everything

## Acceptance Criteria

The Command Center is done when:

1. **Dashboard**: Agent logs in and immediately sees: today's agenda, overdue items, tasks, property health, activity points, and mini calendar — all populated from real data
2. **Calendar**: Full month/week/day/agenda views with colour-coded events, manual creation, and filtering
3. **Auto-events**: Creating a deal auto-generates all deadline events. Creating a property auto-generates document expectation tasks. Lease dates auto-generate renewal reminders.
4. **Tasks**: Kanban board works with drag-and-drop. Tasks link to properties/contacts/deals. Completion writes back to pillars.
5. **Health scores**: Every property has a calculated health score. Neglected properties surface automatically.
6. **Scorecards**: Agents see their own scorecard. BMs see branch comparison. Admin sees all.
7. **Reminders**: Overdue events escalate. Agents get reminded before deadlines. BMs get alerted on stale items.
8. **Notifications**: Bell icon with count. Clickable notifications that navigate to the relevant record.
9. **Settings**: Admin can configure document expectations, reminder schedules, automation rules, and health thresholds.
10. **Permissions**: Every widget, view, and action respects CoreX permission scoping.
11. **iCal**: Agents can subscribe to their CoreX calendar from their phone.
12. **Existing functionality preserved**: Candidate document authorisation widget, activity points — still visible on dashboard.
