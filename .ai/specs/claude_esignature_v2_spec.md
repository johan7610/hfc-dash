## 1. Legal Boundaries

### What CAN be e-signed
- FICA declarations and consent forms
- Mandates (letting mandates, sole mandates, marketing mandates, exclusive authority)
- Mandatory disclosure forms
- POPIA consent forms
- Lease agreements (under 10 years)
- Rental applications
- Inspection reports
- Any internal agency document

### What CANNOT be e-signed (triple-enforced block)
- Agreement for alienation of immovable property (sale agreement / OTP)
- Lease agreements over 10 years
- Template types `sale_agreement` and `otp` are blocked at THREE levels:
  1. Model: `Template::isEsignBlocked()` (Template.php:149-160) — checks template_type AND name patterns
  2. Client JS: `effectiveDeliveryModes` getter (wizard.blade.php:1573-1580) — removes 'esign' from modes
  3. Server: `prepareSigning()` hard block (ESignWizardController.php:1208-1212)

## 3. Template Configuration

### Template Settings — What Each One Does (Audit-Verified)

| Setting | DB Column | What It Does | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Template Name | `name` | Display name | WORKING |
| Category | `category` | Sales/Rentals filter on template list UI. NOT used in wizard for any logic | WORKING (UI only) |
| Document Type | `document_type_id` | FK to document_types. Used for template list filtering AND auto-filing signed docs to contacts/properties | WORKING |
| Template Type | `template_type` | Legal e-sign block for sale_agreement/otp types | WORKING — critical |
| Global | `is_global` | Branch visibility | WORKING |
| Eligible for E-Sign | `is_esign` | Coarse gate: show/hide from wizard template list | WORKING |
| Signing Mode | `party_mode` | Shared (all sign same doc) vs Per Party (separate copy each) | WORKING |
| Allowed Delivery Modes | `allowed_delivery_modes` | Fine-grained: which modes (esign/wet_ink/download) appear in wizard Step 6. Read by getAllowedDeliveryModesArray(), allowsDeliveryMode(), getEffectiveDeliveryModes() | WORKING |
| Security Tier | `security_tier` | Stored but NEVER read by any business logic. Pure pass-through. | DEAD — safe to remove |
| Signing Parties | `signing_parties` | JSON array of roles (owner_party/acquiring_party/agent). Used in 7+ files for sales/rental context detection, signature block rendering, wizard role fallback. Feeds isSalesDocument(). | WORKING — critical |

### is_esign vs allowed_delivery_modes — NOT duplicates
- `is_esign` = "Can this template appear in the wizard at all?" (boolean gate)
- `allowed_delivery_modes` = "Which delivery methods are available?" (fine-grained)
- A template can have `is_esign=true` but `allowed_delivery_modes='wet_ink,download'` (appears in wizard but e-sign mode unavailable)
- Both are needed — independent, complementary gates

### Two "Signing Parties" UI Elements — NOT duplicates

**"Signature Block Parties"** (cds-builder.blade.php:167-237)
- Agency-wide list stored in `agency_signing_parties` table
- Names like: Agent, Seller, Buyer, Lessor, Lessee, Witness
- Used by: signature/initial tag checkboxes ("which parties sign here?")
- Scope: all templates for the agency
- CRUD via DocumentImporterController (store, update, destroy, reorder)

**"Document Signing Roles"** (cds-builder.blade.php:320-346)
- Per-template setting stored in `docuperfect_templates.signing_parties` JSON
- Values: owner_party, acquiring_party, agent
- Used by: sales/rental context detection, signature block rendering, wizard fallback
- Scope: this template only

### Per-Field Settings

**Legacy PDF templates (template editor):**
- `fields_json[].assignedTo` — dropdown: who fills this field (creator/agent/seller/tenant etc)
- Agent fills = editable. Others = read-only with "[Party] will complete" label
- No "editable at signing by" checkboxes exist in legacy editor

**CDS web templates (CDS builder):**
- `field_mappings[].filled_by` — who fills the field initially
- `field_mappings[].editable_by` — array of roles who can EDIT at signing time
- Checkboxes with tooltip: "If none selected, field is locked after agent fills it"
- Role mapping at signing: seller→owner_party, buyer→acquiring_party, agent→agent, witness→witness
- JS converts matching fields to `<input>` elements with amber styling (sign.blade.php:1865-1895)

---

## 4. E-Sign Wizard (6 Steps)

### Step 1: Template Selection
- Shows templates where `is_esign = true`
- Filtered by branch access
- Status: WORKING

### Step 2: Property Selection
- Agent picks a property
- Tracks `_property_source` for context (properties vs rental_properties)
- Status: WORKING

### Step 3: Recipients
- Loads ALL contacts linked to the property via `contact_property` pivot (ESignWizardController:491)
- **BUG #1**: No filtering by template context — all contact types shown regardless of document type
- **BUG #1b**: Auto-populate only works when propertySource === 'properties' — skips rental_properties entirely
- **BUG #1c**: Search API at line 949 uses hardcoded role map instead of esign_role
- **FIX PLANNED**: Use `esign_role` on `contact_types` table to filter contacts based on template's `signing_parties`
- Manual add always available (no filter)
- Status: BROKEN — needs contact filtering + rental property support

### Step 4: Details
- Sales fields or rental fields based on template context
- **BUG #2**: 3-layer context detection has priority flaw. If template has generic roles (owner_party/acquiring_party) AND template name contains 'authority'/'sell'/'mandate', Layer 3 fallback incorrectly returns sales context even for rental properties. Layer 2 (property source) should take precedence but doesn't.
- Status: BROKEN — rental docs show sales fields

### Step 5: Fill & Review
- Agent fills template fields, reviews document preview
- Status: WORKING

### Step 6: Sign & Send
- FICA required toggle (default ON) — stored on signature_request
- Delivery mode selection (filtered by template's allowed_delivery_modes)
- Agent signs
- Send to recipients
- Status: WORKING

---

## 5. Signing Flow

### Agent Signing
- Agent signs first in the wizard
- Signature captured via canvas (draw) or typed name
- All signature/initial markers assigned to agent are rendered
- Status: WORKING

### External Signer Flow
1. Recipient receives email with signing link
2. Opens link → SigningController::show()
3. **FICA Gate**: If `fica_required=true` on the signature_request:
   - Check if contact has FicaSubmission with status in (`submitted`, `under_review`, `agent_approved`, `approved`)
   - If NO → show fica-gate.blade.php with "Complete FICA Form" button
   - If YES → proceed to signing (gate lifts on SUBMISSION, not approval)
4. Document renders with signatures applied so far
5. Recipient signs their assigned blocks
6. Completion → returns to agent for review

### Agent Approval Gate
- After each external party signs, document returns to agent
- Status: `pending_agent_approval`
- Agent reviews what party filled/signed (SignatureController:2004 review())
- Agent approves (SignatureController:2199 approve()) → advances to next party via approveAndAdvance()
- Agent can return to party with notes
- Also handles candidate practitioner flow (awaiting_supervisor, awaiting_supervisor_final)
- Status: WORKING

### Delivery Modes
| Mode | How It Works | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| E-Sign | Web-based signing flow (as above) | WORKING |
| Wet Ink | Document posted to secure portal, printed, signed physically, scanned | WORKING |
| Download Only | PDF generated, agent downloads for manual handling | WORKING |

---

## 6. Signature/Initial Rendering

### Four Systems (Historical)
The codebase has four separate mechanisms that produce signature elements:

1. **HTML @include sig-lines** — CDS compiler inserts `@include('signature-line')` per party in the blade template
2. **Signature Zones** — bounding boxes drawn in setup, expanded to markers via `expandZone()`
3. **Signature Markers** — precise positioned overlays (x%, y%, page) rendered in signing views
4. **Inline sig-line includes** — signature sections rendered in the HTML document itself

### How They Interact
- CDS compiler (step 1) generates the static signature sections in the document HTML
- Zones (step 2) are drawn by the agent in setup and converted to markers
- Markers (step 3) are rendered as floating overlays on top of the paginated HTML
- All three must align to the same coordinate system (pageContainer locked to 210mm width)

### Coordinate System
- pageContainer locked to `width:210mm; max-width:100%` in all three views:
  - setup.blade.php:300
  - sign.blade.php:190
  - external/sign.blade.php:411
- Markers placed before the 210mm width fix may be slightly mispositioned
- New markers placed after the fix are consistent across all views

---

## 7. PDF Generation

### Process
1. Document HTML (merged_html with signatures embedded) → temp HTML file
2. Puppeteer/Chromium renders HTML → PDF via generate-pdf.sh
3. Zoom: 0.82, correct margins, 3-page output matching web view

### Two PDF Types
- **Internal PDF**: Full document with audit certificate
- **Client PDF**: Document without internal audit data
- Both generated by SignaturePdfService::generateFromHtml() (line 99-157)

### BUG #5: Initials Missing from Final PDF
- SignaturePdfService.php:298-301 explicitly skips initials: `if (in_array($type, ['signature', 'initial'])) { continue; }`
- Comment says "handled by signature markers" but marker rendering depends on Alpine.js state that doesn't persist through Puppeteer
- Fix: render initial markers into the HTML before PDF generation, same as signatures

---

## 8. Document Filing

### Auto-Filing on Completion
- `autoFileSignedDocument()` in SignatureService.php:1749
- Splits merged HTML at `.corex-document-wrapper` boundaries
- Generates individual PDF per template in a pack
- Creates separate `Document` records with correct `document_type_id`
- Links to contacts and property via `document_contacts` and `document_properties` pivots

### BUG #4: Duplicate Entry on document_contact
- SignatureService.php:1723-1730 uses `DB::table()->exists()` check followed by `->insert()`
- This is a race condition — concurrent requests can pass the exists() check simultaneously
- Fix: replace with `updateOrCreate()` or `syncWithoutDetaching()` (the latter is already used correctly in linkFiledDocumentToContactsAndProperty at line 1988)

---

## 9. FICA Integration

### FICA Gate in E-Sign
- Wizard Step 6: "FICA verification required" checkbox per recipient (default ON)
- Stored on `signature_requests.fica_required`
- At send time: auto-creates FicaSubmission for contacts without approved FICA
- Gate checks status IN (`submitted`, `under_review`, `agent_approved`, `approved`)
- Gate lifts on SUBMISSION (not approval) — recipient has done their part
- Contact FICA status only updates on final CO approval
- Return-to-signing flow after FICA completion (hidden return_url field)

### FICA Compliance Module (Complete)
- Public token-based form covering all 4 SA FICA schedules (natural, company, trust, partnership)
- Two-stage approval: Agent review → CO review
- TFS screening with embedded FIC iframe + per-field copy buttons
- RMCP Version 4 viewable in-system (all 28 sections + schedules)
- PDF certificate generation
- Compliance dashboard with CO queue, tabs, pipeline indicator
- esign_role on contact_types for future wizard filtering

---

## 10. Amendment/Flag System

### Status: BACKEND COMPLETE, PARTIALLY WIRED

| Component | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| DocumentAmendment model | DocumentAmendment.php | Complete — types: addition/strikeout/modification, statuses: pending/accepted/rejected, soft deletes |
| Amendment review view | amendment-review.blade.php | Built — accept with initial, reject with reason |
| Accept/reject endpoints | SigningController | acceptAmendment(), rejectAmendment() methods |
| Routes | web.php:1245-1251 | GET amendment-review, POST accept, POST reject |
| Clause flags | SigningController:1061-1065 | Stored in web_template_data['clause_flags'] |
| Section reject | rejectSection() route | Allows rejecting individual document sections |

### What's Wired
- "Other Conditions" text changes auto-create amendments
- Amendment → notification → review → accept/reject with initials works for Other Conditions

### What's NOT Wired
- Clause flags are collected but do NOT create amendments
- No manual amendment trigger for agents
- Per the Act: every added condition requires initials from ALL parties — this needs verification

---

## 11. Editable at Signing

### For CDS Web Templates: BUILT, NO TEMPLATE DATA
- Infrastructure works: `field_mappings[].editable_by` → `getEditableFieldsFromMappings()` (SigningController:1197-1235) → JS converts fields to `<input>` (sign.blade.php:1865-1895)
- Role mapping correct: seller→owner_party, buyer→acquiring_party
- **HOWEVER**: No template currently has `field_mappings.editable_by` populated
- System falls back to `WebTemplateFieldPartyMap` static map
- Status: Infrastructure works but is UNTESTED IN PRODUCTION because no template uses it

### For Legacy PDF Templates: LIMITED
- `fields_json[].assignedTo` only controls who FILLS the field
- No "editable at signing" checkboxes exist in legacy editor
- Non-agent parties see fields as read-only

### "Other Conditions" Field
- Should be editable by recipients to add conditions
- Will work once editable_by is populated on the template's field_mappings
- Currently falls back to static map behaviour

---

## 12. Email Notifications

### Rules
- **Agents receive ZERO emails** — all notifications are in-app (database notifications via NotificationController + bell icon)
- **External signers receive exactly TWO emails**:
  1. Signing request (with "Sign Document" button)
  2. Completed PDF (after all parties signed)

---

## 13. Contact Filtering

### Current Behaviour (BROKEN)
ESignWizardController:491 loads ALL contacts from property via `$prop->contacts`. No filtering by template context, signing_parties, category, or contact type. Additionally, auto-populate only works for sales properties (propertySource === 'properties') — skips rental_properties entirely. Search API at line 949 uses hardcoded role map instead of esign_role.

### Solution: esign_role on contact_types
- New column `contact_types.esign_role` (varchar: seller/buyer/lessor/lessee/null)
- Set via dropdown in Settings → Contact Types
- Migration auto-seeds existing types based on name matching
- **NOT YET WIRED INTO WIZARD** — ContactType::scopeForEsignRole() exists but is never called

### Filter Logic (To Be Built)
```
Template signing_parties contains 'owner_party' →
  Show contacts where contact_type.esign_role IN ('seller', 'lessor')

Template signing_parties contains 'acquiring_party' →
  Show contacts where contact_type.esign_role IN ('buyer', 'lessee')

Template signing_parties is null →
  Show all contacts (legacy fallback)

Must also work for rental_properties, not just properties.

Manual add → always available, no filter
```

## 14. Known Bugs (Audit-Verified March 27, 2026)

| # | Bug | Root Cause | Status | Fix |
|---|-----|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | All contact types show on all templates | Wizard:491 loads all contacts, no filter. Also skips rental_properties. | OPEN | Wire esign_role filter + add rental property support |
| 2 | Rental documents show sales fields | Context detection Layer 3 fallback overrides Layer 2 (property source). Template name patterns force sales context. | OPEN | Fix layer priority: property source > name pattern |
| 3 | My Documents menu error | Route and controller exist but may be transient/data issue | UNCLEAR | Needs browser testing |
| 4 | Duplicate entry on document_contact | Race condition: exists() + insert() at SignatureService:1723-1730 | OPEN | Replace with updateOrCreate or syncWithoutDetaching |
| 5 | Final PDF missing initials | Explicit skip at SignaturePdfService:298-301 | OPEN | Render initials into HTML before PDF generation |
| 6 | Ellie bubble overlaps Next button | CSS: position:fixed bottom:24px right:24px z-index:9999 | OPEN | Reposition Ellie |

### Resolved
| # | Bug | Resolution |
|---|-----|-----------|
| 7 | Memory allocation on docuperfect_documents | FIXED — DocumentController uses ->paginate(20) |
| 8 | Wrong email (elizesouthbroom) | DATA FIX — Agent's email wrong in users table on staging, not a code bug |
| WP1 | Web pack: Addendum B signature block never presented to signer | Pack merge concatenated independently-rendered template HTML; segments kept inconsistent data-marker-party keys (lessor vs seller); signer's scan skipped non-matching segments | FIXED — pack-merge loop given single-doc parity (party_names, recipients_by_role, resolveSignatureNames per segment); normalizePackMarkerParties() re-keys all segments to canonical recipient roles; SignatureSurfaceNormalizer made per-wrapper. Commit bab6623 |
| WP2 | Web pack page counter showed template count, not real page count | $pageCount = count(template_ids); paginateDocument() never wrote real count back to totalPages | FIXED (pack-wide) — _syncTotalPagesFromPagination() added; SUPERSEDED by §19 which makes numbering per-document. Commit bab6623 |

## 16. Parked Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Upload signature option | Specced | Third capture mode alongside draw/type |
| Staff FICA verification | Specced | Training records, acknowledgement flow, 12-month cycle |
| Amendment/flag full flow | Backend complete | Only Other Conditions wired. Clause flags inert. |
| Editable at signing | Infrastructure built | No template has field_mappings.editable_by populated |
| Signature upload (image) | Specced | In V2 spec as two-layer approach |
| Registered radio/option CDS field type | Parked (post-demo) | Option 1 of the SALES ADDENDUM B fix: a real registered radio/option field type with `field_mappings` entries + CDS builder support. Correct root-cause fix but a larger CDS-compiler change. Demo uses Option 2 (the `.corex-disclosure-checklist` markup + the existing client converter) instead. |

---

## 17. Build Priority (When Resuming)

1. **Bug #4: Duplicate entry** — replace insert()+exists() with updateOrCreate at SignatureService:1723-1730
2. **Bug #5: Initials in PDF** — render initial markers into HTML before Puppeteer
3. **Bug #1: Contact filtering** — wire esign_role into wizard Step 3 + rental property support
4. **Bug #2: Rental fields** — fix context detection layer priority
5. **Bug #6: Ellie position** — CSS reposition
6. **Verify amendment flow** — test Other Conditions end-to-end
7. **Populate editable_by** — set field_mappings on at least one CDS template to test
8. **Staff FICA training** — build when capacity allows

---

## 18. Hard Rules

- Every VS Code prompt starts with: read CLAUDE.md, .ai/STANDARDS.md, and this spec
- Every prompt ends with: php -l, view:clear, dev-check.ps1, Tinker verification
- No quick fixes — investigate first, report findings, get approval, then fix
- When Johan reports a bug, the code is wrong. Never suggest user error.
- No hard deletes anywhere. Soft deletes only.
- Commit HFC2402 to main and push after every session.
- DO NOT remove working code without full dependency trace.

---

## 19. Per-Document Pagination, Initials & Numbering — APPROVED

> Status: **APPROVED** (Johan, March 2026). Build may proceed on a dev branch.
> Size: **L**. Legally significant — initials and page numbering appear on
> every page of signed mandates/disclosures; Document-Fidelity rule applies.
> Supersedes the pack-wide page counter shipped in WP2 (§14): numbering is
> now per-document, not pack-wide.

### 19.1 Governing principle — a pack is an envelope, not a merge

A document pack combines multiple documents into ONE signing session and ONE
send, but it does **not** make them one document. Each document keeps its own
identity: its own page numbering, its own per-page initials, and its own
terminal signature block. The signer's experience must be identical to
receiving each document separately — exactly as with wet-ink documents handed
over as a set. This makes each filed document independently legally defensible.

Worked example (the canonical test case):

- **Doc 1** — 2 pages → page 1 of 2 (initial), page 2 of 2 (signature block, no initial)
- **Doc 2** — 5 pages → pages 1–4 of 5 (initial each), page 5 of 5 (signature block, no initial)
- **Doc 3** — 1 page → page 1 of 1 (signature block, no initial — it is both first and last page)

### 19.2 Per-document pagination & numbering

- Each `.corex-document-wrapper` paginates **within its own boundary**. A page
  never straddles two documents — doc 1 always ends its own last page, doc 2
  always starts its own page 1. There is no shared/pack-wide page index.
- Page numbering is **per document**: "Page X of N" where N is THAT document's
  page count, restarting at 1 for each document in the pack.
- This **revises** the WP2 fix: `_syncTotalPagesFromPagination()` (added in
  external/sign.blade.php and sign.blade.php) currently counts all
  `.corex-a4-page` elements pack-wide. It MUST instead count
  `.corex-a4-page` elements **within the current document-wrapper**, and the
  displayed "Page X of N" / prev-next bounds MUST reflect the document the
  signer is currently viewing. Single (non-pack) documents are unaffected —
  one wrapper, numbering 1..N as before.

### 19.3 Per-page initials placement

- **What:** every page of every document carries one initial slot per required
  signer, **bottom-right**, EXCEPT the document's last page.
- **Last page = signature page:** the last page of each document carries the
  signature block and **no initial slot**. A single-page document carries the
  signature block and no initial slot (it has no preceding page to initial).
- Rule, stated precisely: an initial slot is placed on page P of a document
  when `P < lastPageIndexOfThatDocument`. The signature block sits on page
  `lastPageIndexOfThatDocument`.
- **When:** at client pagination time, immediately after `paginateDocument()`
  builds the `.corex-a4-page` elements (a4-page-styles.blade.php:~87; called
  from external/sign.blade.php:~1382 & :~1959, sign.blade.php:~690).
- **How:** `_buildInitialsRow()` already exists in a4-page-styles.blade.php
  (~:340) and Strategy-2 already calls it (~:318). PRE-BUILD CHECK: confirm
  whether Strategy-2 is already injecting initials rows in current production
  documents — if so, the build must not double-inject. Strategy-1 and the
  external/agent re-pagination paths must call it consistently, and the
  last-page-exclusion rule above must be applied to ALL paths.
- **Party keys:** initial slots use the same canonical recipient role keys
  produced by `normalizePackMarkerParties()` (ESignWizardController, commit
  bab6623) so the initial scan matches the signer exactly as signatures do.
  Single (non-pack) documents must derive initial party keys from the SAME
  canonical recipient source, so a single-doc initial keys identically to a
  pack-segment initial.

### 19.4 Idempotent re-anchor

Re-pagination (content edit, zoom, font reflow) re-runs `paginateDocument()`.
Because each document paginates within its own wrapper, injection is keyed by
**(documentWrapperIndex, pageIndexWithinWrapper, party)**. On re-run it MUST:
- never duplicate an initials row,
- never lose an already-applied initial value (re-attach captured state by the
  key above),
- remove orphaned rows when a document's page count shrinks,
- correctly move the signature block if the last page of a document changes
  (e.g. doc 2 grows 5→6 pages: old page 5 gains an initial, new page 6 gets
  the signature block).

### 19.5 Interactivity (both signing views)

Injected initials become interactive for the current signer via the EXISTING
`[data-marker-type="initial"]` scan in BOTH external/sign.blade.php and
sign.blade.php (agent), including the existing **apply-to-all** affordance.
Apply-to-all fills every page-initial for that signer across all documents in
the pack in one action (intended — low-friction is the point). No new scanning
mechanism — reuse the initial-marker handler.

### 19.6 Completion gating

The "all items complete" gate MUST add, per document,
`(pages − 1) × requiredSigners` initial items plus the signature-block items,
summed across all documents in the pack. The document MUST NOT complete with
any blank page initial. The gate count MUST be derived from the SAME paginated
DOM the signer sees (per-wrapper page count), never a server estimate.

### 19.7 Persistence / PDF (BUG #5 history)

- Per-signer initials MUST be embedded into `merged_html` in the existing
  signature/initial embed step so the Puppeteer-flattened PDF carries them.
- **Page-count integrity (mandatory mechanism):** each document's PDF MUST be
  generated from that document's **exact signed-and-paginated DOM** — i.e. the
  `.corex-a4-page` elements the signer actually saw and signed are serialized
  and handed to Puppeteer. The PDF generator MUST NOT re-paginate or re-flow
  the content server-side. This guarantees the flattened PDF page count and
  per-page initials match what the signer saw and what the gate counted. Since
  `splitMergedHtml()` already splits per `.corex-document-wrapper`, it splits
  the already-paginated DOM — it does not re-flow it.
- History (§6 / BUG #5, SignaturePdfService.php:298-301): initials have been
  explicitly skipped in the PDF before — the build MUST verify per-page
  initials survive flatten and appear in both the internal and client PDFs.

### 19.8 Files in scope (build)

| Concern | File (approx) |
|---|---|
| Per-wrapper pagination + numbering | resources/views/docuperfect/signatures/partials/a4-page-styles.blade.php |

| Embed into merged_html for PDF | SignatureController.php / SignatureService.php (signature/initial embed step) |
| PDF from exact paginated DOM | SignaturePdfService.php (~:298), generateFromHtml |
| Split keeps per-document pages | SignatureService.php splitMergedHtml (~:1911) |

### 19.9 Acceptance criteria

1. Each document in a pack numbers its own pages "Page X of N" restarting at 1
   per document; prev/next bounds match the current document.
2. Every page of every document shows one initial slot per required signer,
   bottom-right, EXCEPT each document's last (signature) page.
3. A single-page document shows the signature block and no initial slot.
4. Initial slots are interactive for the current signer; apply-to-all works
   across the whole pack.
5. Completion is blocked until every required page initial and every signature
   block, for every signer, across every document, is filled.
6. Re-pagination (add text) re-anchors with no duplicate rows and no lost
   applied initials; if a document's last page changes, the signature block
   moves to the new last page and the former last page gains an initial slot.
7. Completed `merged_html` carries every per-page initial; the flattened PDF
   (internal + client) shows them, and the PDF page count per document matches
   what the signer saw.
8. `splitMergedHtml()` output: each filed document retains exactly its own
   pages, numbering, initials and signature block (none lost, none cross-filed).
9. Single (non-pack) document flow is unchanged except for the new per-page
   initial footer rows.

### 19.10 Risks (must be addressed in build)

- Re-pagination must idempotently re-anchor without duplicating or dropping
  signed initials (state keyed by documentWrapperIndex + pageIndex + party).
- The signature block must follow the document's last page when page count
  changes — a stale signature block on a no-longer-last page is a defect.
- Puppeteer flatten has dropped initials before (§6 BUG #5) — the build MUST
  generate each PDF from the exact paginated DOM and explicitly verify.
- PRE-BUILD: confirm Strategy-2 is not already injecting initials rows in
  production, or the build will double-inject.
- DO NOT assume a setting is "dead" without checking every file that reads it.
