# CoreX OS — Commission & Revenue Share Engine
# Spec v1 — March 27, 2026

> Module: Agency Tracker → Commission Engine
> Purpose: The recruitment and retention engine for the virtual agency model
> Dependencies: Users, Deals, Agency Tracker, Contacts, Properties

---

## 1. Overview

The Commission & Revenue Share Engine is the financial backbone of the
virtual agency model. It calculates agent earnings, tracks commission
splits, manages caps, and distributes revenue share through a multi-tier
sponsorship tree. Every agent can log in and see exactly what they earn,
what they've paid in, how close they are to their cap, and what their
recruited agents are generating for them.

This is what agents talk about when they recruit other agents. Without
this dashboard, there is no virtual agency.

## 2. SA Real Estate Commission Context

- Agency charges seller 5-7.5% + VAT (15%) on property sale price
- Commission is negotiated per mandate and recorded on the deal
- Commission paid by transferring attorney from sale proceeds after registration
- Agent/agency split varies: typically 50/50 for new agents up to 90/10 for top producers
- For rentals: agency earns management fee (typically 10-12% of monthly rental + VAT)
- First month's rental often charged as letting fee
- No regulatory cap on commission amounts (PPRA doesn't regulate fees)

---

## 3. Commission Split Model (Configurable Per Agency)

### Default Model: Cap-Based Split

Similar to eXp but adapted for SA market and configurable per agency.

**Settings (agency-level, configurable in Settings):**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `commission_split_agent` | 80 | Agent percentage (before cap) |
| `commission_split_agency` | 20 | Agency percentage (before cap) |
| `annual_cap` | 160000 | Rands — once agent pays this much to agency, they go to 100% |
| `post_cap_transaction_fee` | 2500 | Rands per transaction after capping |
| `post_cap_fee_cap` | 50000 | Max post-cap fees per year |
| `post_cap_reduced_fee` | 750 | Fee per transaction after post_cap_fee_cap reached |
| `monthly_platform_fee` | 850 | Rands per month |
| `mentor_extra_split` | 20 | Extra % taken on first 3 transactions (split between mentor and agency) |
| `mentor_transactions` | 3 | Number of mentored transactions |
| `risk_management_fee` | 400 | Per transaction |
| `risk_management_cap` | 5000 | Annual cap on risk management fees |
| `revenue_share_enabled` | true | Enable/disable revenue share |
| `revenue_share_pool_percent` | 50 | % of agency's portion that goes to revenue share pool |

### How It Works

```
Deal closes → R1,200,000 sale at 5% commission + VAT
  Total commission: R69,000 (incl VAT)
  Commission excl VAT: R60,000

  If agent has NOT capped:
    Agent gets: R60,000 × 80% = R48,000
    Agency gets: R60,000 × 20% = R12,000
    Agent's cap progress: += R12,000

  If agent HAS capped:
    Agent gets: R60,000 - R2,500 transaction fee - R400 risk fee = R57,100
    Agency gets: R2,900

  Revenue share pool (from agency portion):
    R12,000 × 50% = R6,000 → distributed through sponsorship tree
```

### Cap Anniversary
- Cap resets on agent's anniversary date (date they joined), not calendar year
- Agent can see: "You've paid R98,000 of R160,000 cap — R62,000 to go"
- After cap: "You're capped! 100% commission minus transaction fees"

---

## 4. Revenue Share Model (7-Tier)

### How Revenue Share Works

When an agent closes a deal and pays company dollar (the agency's portion
of the split), 50% of that company dollar goes into a revenue share pool.
That pool is distributed up the sponsorship tree — 7 levels deep.

**Revenue share is paid from REVENUE (before expenses), not profit.**
This is the key differentiator from KW's model and makes payouts predictable.

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Relationship | % of Company Dollar | Unlock Requirement |
|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Agents you personally sponsored | 3.5% | Automatic |
| 2 | Agents sponsored by your Tier 1 | 4.0% | Automatic |
| 3 | Agents sponsored by your Tier 2 | 2.5% | Automatic |
| 4 | Tier 3's recruits | 1.5% | 5+ FLQAs |
| 5 | Tier 4's recruits | 1.0% | 10+ FLQAs |
| 6 | Tier 5's recruits | 0.5% | 15+ FLQAs |
| 7 | Tier 6's recruits | 0.25% | 20+ FLQAs |

**FLQA (First Line Qualifying Agent):** A Tier 1 agent who has closed
at least 2 transactions OR earned R50,000+ GCI in the last 6 months.

### Revenue Share Example

```
Johan sponsors Falan (Tier 1)
Falan sponsors Maggie (Tier 2 to Johan)
Maggie sponsors Retha (Tier 3 to Johan)

Falan closes a deal → company dollar = R12,000
  Revenue share pool: R12,000 × 50% = R6,000
  Johan (Tier 1 sponsor) gets: R6,000 × 3.5% = R210

Maggie closes a deal → company dollar = R10,000
  Revenue share pool: R10,000 × 50% = R5,000
  Johan (Tier 2) gets: R5,000 × 4.0% = R200
  Falan (Tier 1 to Maggie) gets: R5,000 × 3.5% = R175

Retha closes a deal → company dollar = R8,000
  Revenue share pool: R8,000 × 50% = R4,000
  Johan (Tier 3) gets: R4,000 × 2.5% = R100
  Falan (Tier 2 to Retha) gets: R4,000 × 4.0% = R160
  Maggie (Tier 1 to Retha) gets: R4,000 × 3.5% = R140
```

### Revenue Share Rules
- Revenue share is only paid when the producing agent is pre-cap (paying company dollar)
- Once an agent caps, minimal company dollar flows → minimal revenue share
- Post-cap transaction fees DO generate small revenue share
- Revenue share is calculated monthly and paid monthly
- An agent must maintain an active license and platform subscription to receive revenue share
- Revenue share continues even if the sponsoring agent is not actively selling

## 12. Build Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
- Migration: all 6 tables + user column additions
- Models: all 6 with relationships and methods
- CommissionSetting: defaults seeded
- Settings UI: commission split configuration page
- Calculate split logic in CommissionLedger

### Phase 2: Agent Dashboard (Day 1-2)
- My Earnings page with top cards
- Cap progress bar
- Monthly chart (Recharts or Chart.js)
- Recent transactions table
- Commission ledger CRUD

### Phase 3: Revenue Share Engine (Day 2)
- Sponsorship tree (agent_sponsorships)
- Tier calculation logic
- Revenue share distribution from commission events
- Revenue share ledger
- Agent revenue share dashboard

### Phase 4: Principal Dashboard (Day 2-3)
- Agency overview cards
- Agent performance table
- Revenue share tree visualization
- Monthly P&L

### Phase 5: Calculator & Recruitment Tool (Day 3)
- "What if" revenue share calculator
- Shareable projection link for recruitment pitches
- Mentor program tracking

---

## 13. Integration Points

- **Deal completion** → auto-create CommissionLedger entry
- **Agency Tracker** → existing commission data feeds into new engine
- **Agent profile** → shows sponsor, cap status, mentor status
- **SARS IT3(a)** → commission data needed for tax submission (future)
- **Monthly reports** → auto-generate for accounting/Sage

---

## 14. Hard Rules

- All financial calculations use DECIMAL, never FLOAT
- VAT at 15% — always calculated and shown separately
- Soft deletes on all financial records
- Every financial event creates an audit trail entry
- Revenue share only paid from company dollar, never from agent portion
- No agent can sponsor themselves
- Sponsor relationship is permanent (can be transferred by admin only)
- Cap period follows anniversary date, not calendar year
- All amounts in ZAR (South African Rand)
