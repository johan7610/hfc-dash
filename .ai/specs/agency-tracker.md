**Status:** Live — Deal linkage consolidation pending

## What Agency Tracker Does

Agency Tracker is the financial performance engine of CoreX. It tracks all sales and rental transactions, calculates agent commissions, manages branch performance, and provides the principal with real-time financial visibility across the agency.

It is the replacement for the manual spreadsheet-based tracking currently done in Sage.
