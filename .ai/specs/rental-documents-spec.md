## The Rental Flow — Document Sequence

```
LANDLORD ONBOARDING
──────────────────────────────────
Step 1:  Marketing Permission      ← Landlord signs first. Gives agency right to market.
Step 2:  Letting Mandate           ← Landlord signs. Grants mandate to let + bank details.
Step 3:  Mandatory Disclosure      ← Landlord fills property condition report. Lessor signs.
                                      (Tenant + Agent also sign — done at lease stage)

TENANT ONBOARDING
──────────────────────────────────
Step 4:  Rental Application        ← Tenant fills and signs. Pre-approval before any viewing.

LEASE CONCLUSION
──────────────────────────────────
Step 5a: Residential Lease         ← All parties sign: Lessor + Lessee + Agent + Witnesses
  OR
Step 5b: Commercial Lease          ← All parties sign: Lessor + Lessee + Agent + Co-sig + Witnesses

MANDATORY DISCLOSURE (finalised)
──────────────────────────────────
Step 6:  Mandatory Disclosure      ← Tenant and Agent sign to complete (if not done at Step 3)
         (Tenant + Agent sign)
```

**Note on Mandatory Disclosure:** The Lessor signs at Step 3 (before marketing). The Tenant and Agent countersign at Step 5/6 when the lease is concluded. This document spans both stages.

## Document 6: Commercial Lease Agreement

### Purpose
Commercial lease variant — identical structure to residential but with key differences: premises used for business only, no CPA 24-month cap clause, electricity deposit field, different admin fee (R1500), Addendum A includes reOS payment system explanation, cancellation fee R2500 (vs R2000 residential).

### Key Differences from Residential Lease

| Item | Residential | Commercial |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Use clause | Residential purposes | Business purposes — specify business type |
| Admin fee | R1,200 | R1,500 |
| Cancellation fee | R2,000 | R2,500 |
| Electricity deposit | Not separate | Separate field — `deal.electricity_deposit` |
| Business type field | N/A | `deal.business_type` — Clause 3.2 |
| Addendum A title | Service Fee | Commission and Payments |
| reOS payment section | Not present | Present — explains reOS payment reference |
| Limitation of liability clause | Not present | Clause 20 — full liability limitation |

### All other linked fields identical to Residential Lease.

### Signatories (same structure as residential with addition of named co-signature fields)

## Web Document Migration Approach

### What Changes
Every document currently exists as a background image (scanned/photographed original) with text stamped on top via `imagettftext`. This is being retired.

**New approach:** Pure HTML/Blade template → Puppeteer renders to PDF.

### Fidelity Requirements
- Layout must be visually identical to the original document
- Every font size, margin, spacing, and line position must match
- Clause numbering must be exact — no renumbering
- Legal text must be character-perfect — no autocorrection, no smart quotes
- Tables (Mandatory Disclosure checkbox grid) must render pixel-accurately

### Blade Template Structure (per document)

```
resources/views/documents/rental/
  marketing-permission.blade.php
  letting-mandate.blade.php
  mandatory-disclosure.blade.php
  rental-application.blade.php
  lease-residential.blade.php
  lease-commercial.blade.php
```

Each template:
1. Extends a `document-base` layout (agency header, page margins, font)
2. Receives a `$document` model with all linked field values pre-populated
3. Renders blank lines (`_____________`) for any field not yet populated
4. Renders signature blocks as either: blank line (unsigned) | signature image (signed) | uploaded scan (wet ink)
5. Rendered via Puppeteer — not DomPDF

### Signature Block Rendering

Per signature position, the template checks `$signature->status`:
- `unsigned` → render a blank line with role label below
- `electronic` → render the captured signature image
- `wet_ink` → render the uploaded scan image
- `pending` → render a "Awaiting signature" placeholder (for in-progress documents)

---

## Data Model Requirements

### New Fields Needed (verify against existing migrations)

**`deals` table additions:**
- `rental_amount` (decimal)
- `commission_rate` (decimal — from settings default)
- `mandate_end_date` (date)
- `commencement_date` (date)
- `expiry_date` (date)
- `earliest_termination_date` (date)
- `escalation_rate` (decimal)
- `escalation_start_month` (string)
- `renewal_period_months` (integer)
- `electricity_deposit` (decimal)
- `occupation_date` (date)
- `lease_term_months` (integer)
- `occupants_adults` (integer)
- `occupants_children` (integer)
- `pets_allowed_description` (text, nullable)
- `business_type` (string, nullable — commercial only)
- `lets_assist_fee` (decimal, nullable)
- `special_conditions` (text, nullable)
- `other_conditions` (text, nullable)

**`contacts` table additions (verify existing):**
- `bank_account_holder` (string, nullable)
- `bank_name` (string, nullable)
- `bank_account_number` (string, nullable)
- `bank_branch_code` (string, nullable)
- `marital_status` (string, nullable)
- `spouse_name` (string, nullable)
- `spouse_id` (string, nullable)
- `citizenship` (string, nullable)
- `current_address` (text, nullable)
- `emergency_contact_name` (string, nullable)
- `emergency_contact_phone` (string, nullable)
- `employer_name` (string, nullable)
- `employer_position` (string, nullable)
- `employer_address` (text, nullable)
- `employer_phone` (string, nullable)
- `monthly_salary` (decimal, nullable)

## Signing Sequence Per Flow

### Landlord Onboarding Pack (Steps 1–3)
Sent to landlord as a pack. Signing order:
1. Landlord signs Marketing Permission
2. Landlord signs Letting Mandate
3. Landlord signs/fills Mandatory Disclosure (Lessor section only)

All three can be sent together. Landlord signs all three before tenant search begins.

### Tenant Application (Step 4)
Sent to prospective tenant independently. Not linked to a specific lease yet.
1. Tenant completes and signs Rental Application (both signature blocks)
2. Application reviewed internally
3. If approved → Lease flow begins

### Lease Pack (Steps 5–6)
Sent as a pack once tenant is approved:
1. Landlord signs Residential/Commercial Lease (Lessor section)
2. Tenant signs Lease (Lessee section)
3. Agent signs Lease (Agent section)
4. Addendum A signed by all three
5. Tenant signs Mandatory Disclosure (Tenant section)
6. Agent signs Mandatory Disclosure (Property Practitioner section)

### Sequential Signing Logic
- Landlord receives pack first → signs → Tenant notified → signs → Agent countersigns
- Each notification goes via DocuPerfect email with agent's signature injected
- Document is flattened after each signature before being sent to next signer

---

## Implementation Priority Order

Build in this sequence — each document is simpler than the last, building up the Blade component library:

1. **Rental Application** — single signer, no complex layout, good starter
2. **Marketing Permission** — straightforward, establishes agency header component
3. **Letting Mandate** — adds bank details section
4. **Mandatory Disclosure** — introduces the checkbox table component
5. **Residential Lease** — the longest and most complex
6. **Commercial Lease** — variation of residential, reuse components
