# CoreX Per-Agency Feature Registry — Spec

> Status: **Draft pending Johan approval** — 2026-07-18
> Owner: (QA2 lane)
> Pillars touched: ALL FOUR (Property, Contact, Deal, Agent) — the registry governs which
> *modules* an agency runs, and every module reads/writes one or more pillars. The registry
> itself owns only agency-scoped capability config (Non-negotiable #10 N/A — ingests no
> property/contact/deal data).
> Sister specs: `.ai/specs/multi-tenancy.md`, `.ai/specs/corex-domain-events-spec.md`,
> `.ai/specs/agency-onboarding-setup.md`, `.ai/specs/agency-onboarding-feature-switchboard.md`
> (which becomes the *onboarding face* of this registry — see §7).

## 0. One-paragraph summary

CoreX has ~50 modules (Presentations, DocuPerfect, Compliance, Payroll, Rentals, Prospecting,
Communications, …) but no per-agency way to say *"this agency uses these ten and not the other
forty."* Everything is gated only by **permission** ("may this USER touch it"), which is the
wrong axis for "does this AGENCY use this module at all" — an agency that doesn't do rentals
still has every agent's Role Manager showing rental permissions, and the Rentals panel still
renders for anyone holding `view_rentals`. This spec introduces a **per-agency feature gate**
that is a **new, orthogonal layer** on top of permissions: nav + routes require **permission
AND feature**; a feature turned OFF hides the module for the whole agency (never deletes data);
one **registry** (`config/corex-features.php`) is the single source that feeds nav-gating,
route-gating, the Settings page, AND the onboarding wizard — so adding a feature once surfaces
it in all four automatically. This is how Non-negotiables #2 (nav same-day) and #10a (wizard
surfacing) become **structural** instead of manual.

---

## 1. What this feature does and why (business requirement)

**Today.** A new agency gets *all* of CoreX. There is no supported way to sell/enable CoreX
module-by-module, to hide a module an agency will never use, or to phase a module in. The
`agency-onboarding-feature-switchboard.md` step added six capability toggles
(`marketing`, `syndication_p24`, `syndication_pp`, `matches`, `split_branches`, `website`) —
but those are six hand-coded rows writing to six ad-hoc stores (`PerformanceSetting` keys +
`agencies` columns). There is no registry, no generalised gate, and nav/route visibility is not
driven by them. The switchboard is the right idea at the wrong scale.

**This registry generalises it.** One catalogue of every toggleable feature; one per-agency
enablement store; one universal gate (`AgencyFeatureService::enabled($key)`); one
`@feature`/`feature:` pair mirroring `@permission`/`permission:`. The six switchboard toggles
become the **first six registry rows** (§7) — nothing is wasted, the switchboard becomes the
onboarding *face* of the registry.

### Why it makes CoreX *best*, not merely *working*
A permission system alone is *working*. A product that an agency can be **sold and provisioned
module-by-module**, whose nav adapts to what they bought, whose onboarding walks only the
modules they enabled, and whose Role Manager isn't cluttered with permissions for modules they
don't run — that is the shape of a real operating system, and it is the front door to per-module
pricing (ties into `agency-billing.md`). Critically, the registry makes "a new page appears in
nav the same day" and "a new setting appears in the wizard the same day" **structural** — you
add one registry row and all four surfaces pick it up — instead of four manual steps a future
build will forget.

---

## 2. Pillar connections

The registry configures **agency-wide capability state**; it does not own pillar rows, it
governs which modules (each of which reads/writes pillars) are live:

| Pillar | How a feature gate touches it |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Property** | Marketing / syndication / presentations / viewing-packs / prospecting govern how Properties are marketed, valued, and pushed to portals; the public website governs how they are shown. |
| **Contact** | Core Matches / Outreach / Communications govern how buyer-Contacts are matched, contacted, and archived. |
| **Deal** | Agency Tracker / Commission / DocuPerfect / Compliance feed the deal lifecycle and its paperwork. |
| **Agent** (`User`) | Payroll / Leave / Multi-branch / Training govern how agents are paid, grouped, and developed; permissions still gate *which* agents may act. |

Per Non-negotiable #4: reads agency-scoped capability config and writes enriched config back.
Not an island — it is the switchboard the pillars' modules already answer to.

---

## 3. Architecture decisions (LOCKED)

### 3.1 The feature gate is a NEW layer ORTHOGONAL to permissions
Two independent axes, **AND-composed**:

- **Feature** = *"does this AGENCY use this module?"* — per-agency, set by an admin/owner.
- **Permission** = *"may this USER touch it?"* — per-user (per-role), set in Role Manager.

Nav visibility and route access require **BOTH**: `@feature('rentals') && @permission('view_rentals')`.
- A feature being ON **never grants a permission** (a user still needs the permission).
- A feature being OFF hides the module for **everyone** in the agency, regardless of permission.
- The two never merge into one store. A feature key is not a permission key; `hasFeature()` is
  not `hasPermission()`. This separation is the load-bearing decision — it is what stops the
  registry from becoming a second, conflicting access-control system.

### 3.2 OFF hides only — it never deletes data (Non-neg #1/#6)
Turning a feature off hides its nav + 404s its routes. It does **not** soft-delete or touch any
record. Re-enabling restores access to every existing row exactly as it was. A feature toggle is
a *visibility/entry* control, never a data operation. (This mirrors `mentor_program_enabled` in
`agency-onboarding-setup.md` §5.2: "off means off, not merely hidden" applied to a whole module
— off means the module's doors are shut, but its filing cabinets are untouched.)

### 3.3 CORE features are never toggleable
The four pillars plus the surfaces every user needs are `core: true` and always resolve enabled
— the gate short-circuits them before any store lookup. Core set (§5.2). A `core` feature can
still carry a registry row (so nav/onboarding can reference it) but its toggle is never rendered
and `enabled()` returns true unconditionally.

### 3.4 The registry is the single source of truth for four surfaces
`config/corex-features.php` feeds — automatically, from one row:
1. **Nav gating** (`@feature` on the sidebar item — §5),
2. **Route gating** (`feature:<key>` middleware on the module's prefix group — §6/§8),
3. **Settings page** (the Features section renders the registry — §6),
4. **Onboarding wizard** (the capabilities step auto-derives its toggle list — §7).

Adding a feature = adding one registry row (+ wiring its nav/route in the same commit, per
Non-neg #2). The row is what makes #2 and #10a structural.

### 3.5 Resolution order (LOCKED)
`AgencyFeatureService::enabled($key, ?Agency)` resolves, in order, short-circuiting on the first
decisive answer:

1. **Unknown key** → `false` (fail-closed; log a warning — a typo must not silently pass).
2. **Global env kill-switch** (`config/features.php`, if the feature maps to a global flag) is
   **off** → `false` for everyone (outer AND; a platform-wide disable wins over any agency ON).
3. **`core: true`** → `true` (always; before any store read).
4. **`depends_on` parent resolves off** → `false` (dependency cascade; a child cannot be on
   while its parent is off — §3.6).
5. **`agency_features` row exists** for `(agency_id, feature_key)` → that row's `enabled`.
6. **No row** → the registry entry's `default` (bool).

Request-cached: the full resolved feature map for the current agency is computed once per request
(one query, `WHERE agency_id = :id`) and memoised, so `enabled()` in a Blade loop is O(1).

### 3.6 Dependency cascade (`depends_on`)
A feature may declare `depends_on: [parentKey, …]`. If **any** parent resolves off, the child
resolves off (regardless of its own row). This is evaluated in the resolver, not stored, so
toggling a parent off instantly cascades. Cycles are forbidden (validated by a test + the sync
command). Example: `esign` `depends_on` `docuperfect`; `leave` `depends_on` `payroll` (proposed
— §17 open decision).

### 3.7 Multi-tenancy (Non-neg #7 / multi-tenancy spec)
`agency_features` carries `agency_id` from migration day one, uses `BelongsToAgency` (auto-fill +
`AgencyScope`). No `withoutGlobalScope` in request code. The **owner tracking / cross-agency**
paths (if any) use `queryWithoutAgencyScope()` explicitly, gated on `isOwnerRole()`. The gate
reads the agency via the canonical `$user->effectiveAgencyId()` (never `session('active_agency_id')`
directly), so an owner using the agency switcher sees the switched-into agency's features.

### 3.8 Domain event (Non-neg #9)
Toggling a feature emits `App\Events\AgencyFeatureToggled` (past-tense fact) carrying
`agencyId`, `featureKey`, `enabled` (new state), `changedByUserId`. Added to the events
catalogue (`corex-domain-events-spec.md` §5). **Registration reality (memory / AT-261):** event
auto-discovery is OFF — any listener must be explicitly registered in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`,
and a **queued** listener on a domain event fatals (`AbstractDomainEvent`'s readonly `$eventId`
can't be restored in the child scope). So: the listener is **sync** and does only cheap work
(bust the request cache / write an audit row); anything heavier dispatches a **Job carrying
scalars**. v1 needs no downstream listener beyond the universal `RecordDomainEvent` audit writer.

---

## 4. Data model / migrations

### 4.1 New table `agency_features`
Model `App\Models\AgencyFeature` — `use BelongsToAgency, SoftDeletes` (Non-neg #1).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | bigint PK | |
| `agency_id` | FK → agencies, **NOT NULL**, indexed | multi-tenancy day-one (#7) |
| `feature_key` | string(80), indexed | matches a `config/corex-features.php` key |
| `enabled` | boolean, default true | the per-agency override |
| `updated_by` | FK → users, nullable | who last flipped it (audit) |
| timestamps + `deleted_at` | | SoftDeletes |

- **Unique index** `(agency_id, feature_key)` among non-soft-deleted rows (one live override per
  feature per agency). Resolution is registry-default when no row exists — the table stores only
  *deviations from default*, so it stays small.
- Casts: `enabled => boolean`.
- No `enabled_at`/history table in v1 — the domain-event audit log (`domain_event_log`) is the
  history of toggles.

### 4.2 Backfill migration + idempotent command (BUILD_STANDARD §8)
Agencies that exist before this feature must see **no change on deploy** — every module currently
visible to them must resolve ON. Because "no row ⇒ default", and defaults are set so the
*current* behaviour is preserved (§5.3), a fresh agency needs **no backfill rows at all** for
default-ON features. The backfill exists for the few features whose registry **default is OFF**
but which some existing agency is currently *using* (e.g. an agency that already has the
switchboard's `matches_enabled` PerformanceSetting on, or rentals data): it writes an explicit
`enabled = true` row so a default-OFF feature they already use is not hidden.

- Migration `xxxx_backfill_agency_features` delegates to idempotent command
  `agency:backfill-features` (runs on `migrate --force`, safe to re-run).
- The command, per existing live (non-demo) agency, sets `enabled = true` for any feature the
  agency is **currently exercising** — detected from existing signals: the switchboard's
  `PerformanceSetting`/`agencies` columns (marketing/matches/syndication/split-branches/website),
  presence of rows in a module's tables (e.g. `rental_*`, `payroll_*`, `presentations`), or the
  module's `access_*` permission being granted to any role in that agency. **Conservative:
  default-ON features are left rowless (they resolve ON anyway); only default-OFF-but-in-use gets
  an explicit ON row.** No feature is ever turned OFF by the backfill.
- New migration ⇒ `php artisan schema:dump` (against the TEST DB — memory
  [[schema_dump_from_test_db]]) + commit the snapshot (#12a).

### 4.3 No changes to existing tables
The switchboard's existing stores (`PerformanceSetting` keys, `agencies.split_branches_enabled`,
`agencies.website_enabled`) are **kept** as the backing store for those six capability toggles
(§7) — the registry does not migrate them into `agency_features`; it *reads through* to them for
those six keys via a per-feature resolver adapter (§7.2), so the switchboard and the settings
page keep writing where they always did. New module features (rentals, payroll, …) use
`agency_features` rows. This avoids a risky data migration and keeps the six switchboard toggles
on their proven savers.

---

## 5. The catalogue — `config/corex-features.php`

### 5.0 Default-on policy (Johan, 2026-08-12)

Every non-core module feature defaults `true` for a brand-new agency, **except** the four that
publish something externally or restructure how the agency operates, which stay deliberately
`false`: `syndication-p24`, `syndication-pp` (auto-push listings to real portals — must be a
conscious go-live decision, never a default, even once credentials exist), `public-website`
(the agency's public site going live before branding/listings are set up — also pulled from the
onboarding wizard entirely, see `.ai/specs/agency-onboarding-setup.md` §5.1), and `multi-branch`
(a structural mode switch — changes agent data-visibility scoping platform-wide, not just a menu
item — its `agencies.split_branches_enabled` DB column also still defaults `false`).

Reason for the change: a brand-new agency's admin logging in for the first time found the
"Branch Manager" sidebar section (Payroll + Leave Management) completely empty — both modules
defaulted off, and neither had been visited in the onboarding wizard yet. Rather than defaulting
every new module off and making the admin discover and enable each one individually, the
registry now defaults new agencies to the full toolkit **minus** the handful of switches with a
real external or structural consequence.

### 5.1 Entry shape
```php
'rentals' => [
    'label'            => 'Rentals',
    'category'         => 'People & Property',
    'explain'          => 'The full rental workflow — lease capture, active/expired lease '
                        . 'tracking, rental document types and rent-related reminders.',
    'affects'          => 'Whether the Rentals area and its leases appear for your agents, and '
                        . 'whether CoreX chases rental renewals. Off hides it; existing leases '
                        . 'are untouched and reappear when you turn it back on.',
    'default'          => true,         // bool — on/off for a brand-new agency (§5.0: true unless
                                         // it publishes externally or restructures the agency)
    'core'             => false,        // core features are never toggleable (always on)
    'depends_on'       => [],           // [feature keys] — off if any parent is off
    'nav_permission'   => ['view_rentals'], // the permission(s) the nav item already checks
    'sidebar_section'  => 'hidden.rentals',  // sidebar panel/group key (documentation + nav map)
    'settings_section' => 'feature-rentals', // $railGroups anchor in corex/settings.blade.php
    'route_prefixes'   => ['rental', 'rentals'], // for the phase-4 feature:<key> middleware
    'global_flag'      => null,         // optional key in config/features.php for the outer AND
],
```

- `explain` — a full sentence: what the module is (STANDARDS F.8, no jargon, no codenames).
- `affects` — rendered "What this changes:" — a concrete, observable consequence; **tautologies
  forbidden** (parent onboarding §5.1). "Whether rentals are enabled" is banned; "whether the
  Rentals area appears and whether CoreX chases rental renewals" is required.
- `route_prefixes` — the `->prefix('…')` strings (verified from `routes/web.php`) the phase-4
  `feature:<key>` middleware attaches to. Empty for pure-capability toggles (§7) with no prefix.
- `nav_permission` / `sidebar_section` — the mapping the sidebar `@feature` guard uses (§5.4).

### 5.2 CORE features (never toggleable — `core: true`)
Confirmed from the sidebar + route enumeration. These carry a registry row (so nav/onboarding can
reference them) but their toggle is never rendered and `enabled()` is always true:

`dashboard` (Command Center), `properties`, `contacts`, `deals` (Deal Register DR1),
`agents` (Users/people admin), `my-portal`, `settings`, `company-settings`,
`role-manager` (permissions governance). The entire **System Developer** band (`@if($isOwner)`)
is platform-owner tooling — **not tenant features at all** and excluded from the registry.

### 5.3 The toggleable catalogue (derived — grain is an OPEN DECISION §17)
Grouped by category. `def` = proposed default for a NEW agency. Route prefixes are the verified
`->prefix()` strings; a `+` means "several — see the route audit". **Grain, defaults, and
core-vs-toggle are exactly what Johan signs off (§17)** — this is the derived starting point, not
a fait accompli.

**Switchboard-origin capability toggles (folded in as the FIRST 6 rows — §7):**

| key | label | def | backing store (kept) |
|-----|-------|-----|----------------------|
| `marketing` | Marketing | on | `PerformanceSetting: marketing_enabled` |
| `syndication-p24` | Publish to Property24 | off | `PerformanceSetting: syndication_p24_enabled` |
| `syndication-pp` | Publish to Private Property | off | `PerformanceSetting: syndication_pp_enabled` |
| `core-matches` | Core Matches | on | `PerformanceSetting: matches_enabled` |
| `multi-branch` | Multi-branch offices | off | `agencies.split_branches_enabled` |
| `public-website` | Public website | off | `agencies.website_enabled` |

**Module/page features (new `agency_features` rows):**

| key | label | category | def | depends_on | nav_permission | route_prefixes |
|-----|-------|----------|-----|------------|----------------|----------------|
| `presentations` | Presentations & CMA | Valuations | on | — | `access_presentations` | `presentations`, `corex/presentations/refresh-requests` |
| `commercial-evaluations` | Commercial Evaluations | Valuations | off | — | `access_commercial_evaluations` | `commercial-evaluations` |
| `prospecting` | Market Intelligence / Prospecting | Prospecting | on | — | `access_prospecting` | `prospecting`, `corex/market-intelligence`, `corex/tracked-properties` |
| `viewing-packs` | Viewing Packs | Properties | on | — | `access_viewing_packs` | `viewing-packs` |
| `portal-leads` | Portal Leads | Prospecting | off | — | `access_portal_leads` | `real-estate/portal-leads` |
| `outreach` | Seller Outreach & Canvassing | Prospecting | off | — | `outreach.summary.view` | `real-estate/outreach-*`, `contacts/{c}/outreach`, `settings/outreach-templates`, `compliance/seller-info` |
| `ad-manager` | Ad Manager | Marketing | off | `marketing` | `access_ad_manager` | `tools/ad-manager` (loose) |
| `docuperfect` | DocuPerfect (documents & e-sign) | Documents | on | — | `access_docuperfect` | `docuperfect` (incl. `docuperfect/compiler`, e-sign) |
| `document-library` | Document Library | Documents | on | — | `access_document_library` | `documents` |
| `shared-drive` | Shared Drive | Documents | off | — | `access_shared_drive` | `documents/shared-drive` |
| `filing-register` | Filing Register | Documents | on | — | `access_filing_register` | `filing-register` (loose) |
| `compliance` | Compliance (FICA/RMCP/Policy/Screening) | Compliance | on | — | `access_compliance` | `compliance/*` (fica, rmcp-dashboard, policy-dashboard, screenings, verification-queue, document-types, agency-settings, whistleblow) |
| `communications` | Communications (WhatsApp/email capture & archive) | Communications | off | — | `access_communication`+ | `communications/*`, `compliance/communication*`, `settings/email-setup`, `my-portal/communication-capture` |
| `agency-tracker` | Agency Tracker (worksheet/targets/performance/deal register) | Deals | on | — | `access_agency_tracker` | worksheet/`bm`/`admin` performance + `deals-dr2` |
| `commission-management` | Commission Management | Deals | on | `agency-tracker` | (role) | `commission` (loose) |
| `payroll` | Payroll | People | off | — | `manage_payroll` | `payroll` |
| `leave` | Leave Management | People | off | `payroll` | `manage_leave`+ | `payroll/leave`, `my-portal/leave` |
| `staff-take-on` | Staff Take-On | People | off | — | `manage_staff_take_on` | `staff-take-on` |
| `agent-onboarding` | Agent Onboarding (applications) | People | off | — | (role) | `onboarding` |
| `rentals` | Rentals | People & Property | off | — | `view_rentals` | `rental` |
| `ellie` | Ellie AI | AI & Learning | on | — | `access_ellie` | `ellie` (loose) |
| `training` | Training / LMS | AI & Learning | on | — | (route-exists) | `training`, `training-help` |
| `knowledge-base` | Knowledge Base | AI & Learning | on | — | `access_knowledge_base` | `admin/knowledge` |
| `pdf-suite` | PDF Suite | Tools | on | — | `access_pdf_suite` | `tools/pdf-suite` |
| `image-converter` | Image Converter | Tools | on | — | `access_image_converter` | `tools/image-converter` |
| `calculators` | Calculators (commission/CMA/deposit) | Tools | on | — | `access_calculators` | `deposit-interest-calculator`, `calculators` (loose) |
| `trust-interest` | Trust Interest Register | Tools | off | — | `access_trust_interest` | `admin/deposit-trust-interest` |
| `proforma-invoices` | Proforma Invoices | Deals | off | — | `proforma.manage` | `proforma` |
| `marketing-suppressions` | Marketing Suppressions | Marketing | off | `marketing` | `marketing_suppressions.view` | `admin/marketing-suppressions` (loose) |
| `tv-display` | TV Display | Tools | off | — | `manage_tv_messages` | `admin/tv-messages`, `bm/tv-messages` (loose) |
| `guided-tours` | Guided Tours | Tools | on | — | (none) | `corex/guided-tours` (loose) |

That is **6 capability + 31 module = 37 toggleable features** across 12 categories — inside the
20-40 target, at the fly-out-panel / settings-section grain. §17 lists the merges Johan may want
(e.g. fold `commission-management` into `agency-tracker`, `ad-manager` into `marketing`,
`trust-interest` into `calculators`, split `docuperfect`/`esign`).

### 5.4 Sidebar/route cross-reference is VERIFIED, not guessed
Every `route_prefixes` value above is a real `->prefix('…')` string from `routes/web.php`; every
`nav_permission` is the real `@permission(...)` guard on that sidebar item. "(loose)" marks a
prefix that lives inside the broad `corex` auth group or has no dedicated prefix group — those
route-gate **per-route**, not by prefix (§8). This honesty is the point of the investigation.

---

## 6. The gate mechanism (mirror the permission system exactly)

Investigated verbatim (agent audit); mirror each 1:1.

### 6.1 `AgencyFeatureService`
`App\Services\Features\AgencyFeatureService`:
- `enabled(string $key, ?Agency $agency = null): bool` — the §3.5 resolver, request-cached.
- `all(?Agency $agency = null): array` — the resolved `key => bool` map (drives Settings + the
  wizard's auto-derive).
- `resolveAgencyId()` — copies the canonical guarded idiom from `BelongsToAgency`:
  `method_exists($user,'effectiveAgencyId') ? $user->effectiveAgencyId() : ($user->agency_id ?? null)`.
- Request cache: a `['agencyId' => map]` memo on the singleton; busted by `AgencyFeatureToggled`.
- The six switchboard keys resolve through a small **adapter** that reads their existing store
  (§7.2) instead of `agency_features`, so there is one `enabled()` API over both stores.

### 6.2 `hasFeature()` on User + `feature()` helper + `@feature` directive
- `User::hasFeature(string $key): bool` → `app(AgencyFeatureService::class)->enabled($key)`
  (mirrors `User::hasPermission`).
- `function feature(string $key): bool` global helper (mirrors the existing permission helper).
- **Blade directive** registered right after `@permission` at `AppServiceProvider.php:702`,
  identical shape (`Blade::if`, not `Blade::directive`):
  ```php
  Blade::if('feature', fn (string $key) => auth()->check() && auth()->user()->hasFeature($key));
  ```
  Usage: `@feature('rentals') … @endfeature`. Guests → false (fail-closed).

### 6.3 `CheckFeature` middleware + alias
`App\Http\Middleware\CheckFeature` mirrors `CheckPermission` (variadic OR semantics) but
**`abort(404)`** when off — a disabled module must be *invisible*, not *forbidden* (a 403 leaks
that the module exists):
```php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next, string ...$featureKeys): Response
{
    $svc = app(AgencyFeatureService::class);
    $allowed = collect($featureKeys)->contains(fn ($k) => $svc->enabled($k));
    abort_unless($allowed, 404);
    return $next($request);
}
```
Alias `'feature' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckFeature::class` added to the `$middleware->alias([…])`
block in `bootstrap/app.php` (alongside `permission`, `agency.setup.portal`, …). Route usage:
`->middleware('feature:rentals')` — composes with the existing `permission:view_rentals` (both
must pass).

### 6.4 The Settings "Features" page
- New **"Features"** rail entry in the **Modules** `$railGroups` group of
  `resources/views/corex/settings.blade.php` (in-page section, anchor `features`). It renders the
  registry **grouped by `category`**, each feature a toggle showing its `label` + `explain` +
  "What this changes:" `affects`; core features are shown as a locked "Always on" row (no toggle);
  a feature whose `depends_on` parent is off renders disabled with a "Turn on <parent> first" note.
- **One canonical saver** `FeatureSettingsController@update`:
  - `$request->has($key)`-guarded per toggle (parent onboarding §6.1 — MANDATORY); the form posts
    a **hidden `"0"` companion** for every rendered toggle so unchecked still saves false and an
    *absent* key leaves the value alone. Never a bare `$request->boolean()`.
  - Writes each toggled key: switchboard-six → their existing savers (§7.2); module features →
    `AgencyFeature::updateOrCreate(['agency_id'=>…,'feature_key'=>$key],['enabled'=>…,'updated_by'=>…])`.
  - Emits `AgencyFeatureToggled` per changed key (only on an actual state change).
- **New permission** `agency_features.manage` in `config/corex-permissions.php` (module
  `settings`, `admin` via all-minus-exclude, owner bypass) — gates the Features section (sidebar
  entry + route middleware + controller). After deploy: `corex:sync-permissions --merge-defaults`
  (multi-tenancy spec). Surfaced in the wizard per §7 (the capabilities step *is* the surfacing).

### 6.5 `corex:sync-features` (optional, symmetry with permissions)
The registry is a config file (no DB catalogue table needed — `agency_features` stores only
overrides, keyed by the config key). A light `corex:features:validate` command asserts the config
is well-formed (no dependency cycles, every `route_prefixes`/`nav_permission` resolvable, no
orphan `settings_section`) and is run in the focused test. No table sync is required (unlike
permissions, which need a `nexus_permissions` catalog row per key for Role Manager).

## 7. Onboarding integration — the capabilities step auto-derives from the registry

### 7.1 Auto-derive (supersedes the hand-coded 6)
`agency-onboarding-feature-switchboard.md`'s `capabilities` step currently hand-codes six toggle
controls. Under this registry it **auto-derives** its control list by iterating
`AgencyFeatureService::all()` for the **non-core** features, grouped by `category`. Adding a
registry row therefore surfaces the toggle in onboarding automatically — Non-neg #10a becomes
structural. The step's copy (`what` card) is unchanged; each toggle's `explain`/`affects` come
straight from the registry entry (single source — the settings page and the wizard render the
same strings, they cannot drift).

### 7.2 The six switchboard toggles become the first six registry rows
The six existing toggles are registered as registry entries (§5.3) whose **backing store is kept**
(PerformanceSetting keys + `agencies` columns). A per-feature **store adapter** on
`AgencyFeatureService` routes those six keys' reads/writes to their existing store and their
existing savers (`updateMarketingEnabled`, `updateSyndicationPortals`, `updateMatchesEnabled`,
`updateSplitBranches`, `toggleWebsite`), so:
- the switchboard's already-shipped savers + §6.1 hardening are reused (no rewrite),
- `enabled('core-matches')` returns the same value the matches gate already reads,
- nothing about the shipped switchboard behaviour changes — it just now *is* the onboarding face
  of the registry.

### 7.3 Adaptive step-gating generalises
The switchboard spec's step-gating (`matches` step skipped when `matches_enabled` off) generalises:
`AgencyOnboardingSetup::stepGates()` reads `AgencyFeatureService::enabled($key)` for each
feature-detail step, and the progress denominator is the active-step count. Adding a feature with
a detail step registers one `stepGates` entry. (This is a refactor of the switchboard's already-
generic `stepGates()`/`activeSteps()` — see that spec §7.)

### 7.4 Required edit to the switchboard spec (on approval)
On approval, `agency-onboarding-feature-switchboard.md` gets a note that its `capabilities` step
**now derives its toggle list from the feature registry** (the six controls become the first six
registry rows; the step iterates `AgencyFeatureService::all()` non-core by category). Listed in
§14 files-to-modify. **Not edited now** — that spec stays as shipped until this registry is
approved, so we don't pre-empt Johan.

## 8. Honest route-gating scope (no over-claim)

Route-gating is **defense-in-depth**; nav-gating delivers the visible win. The route audit
(97 prefix groups) classifies cleanly:

| Class | Count | Route-gating approach |
|-------|-------|-----------------------|
| **(a) Clean single-module prefix group** | ~61 | Add `feature:<key>` to the group `->middleware([...])` — one line per group. **Phase 4 targets, one prompt per module.** |
| **(b) CORE pillar group** | ~21 | **Never feature-gate** (properties/contacts/deals/dashboard/settings/api). Permission-gated as today. |
| **(c) Broad / shared per-route** | ~15 | Owner-only admin bundles + mixed-permission groups. Route-gate **per-route where a clean feature applies**; otherwise nav-gating + the controller's existing permission is the guard. Tracked per module, added incrementally — **no blanket claim that every route is feature-gated in v1.** |

**Stated limitation:** many routes live inside the one broad `Route::middleware(['auth','verified'])
->prefix('corex')` group (lines ~1401–3125) with per-route permissions. Feature route-gating
applies **cleanly to the ~61 class-(a) prefix groups first**; loose routes (marked "(loose)" in
§5.3) are added per-module as each module's phase-4 slice lands. **Nav-gating (phase 3) hides the
entry for the whole agency immediately; route-gating (phase 4) is the belt-and-braces that stops
a hand-typed URL.** A feature is "nav-gated" the day its `@feature` guard lands; it is
"route-gated" when its prefix group (or each loose route) gets `feature:<key>`. The spec does not
pretend these happen together.

### 8.1 Sidebar integration — guard item-by-item (recommended), do NOT re-render from the registry
**Recommendation: wrap each gated sidebar item with a parallel `@feature('key')` alongside its
existing `@permission`, mapped via the registry's `sidebar_section`/`nav_permission` metadata.**
Justification: `corex-sidebar.blade.php` is a hand-tuned 2,333-line Blade with five role bands,
nested fly-out panels, per-item role logic, `Route::has` guards and careful ordering. A
registry-driven re-render would be a high-risk rewrite that regresses that UX for no user-visible
gain (INVESTIGATE→COPY→ADAPT; CLAUDE.md "no risky rewrites"). Item-by-item `@feature` guards are
surgical, reviewable, and diff-clean. The registry's nav metadata *documents* the mapping so a
future phase could template it; v1 wraps existing items. A test asserts every non-core registry
feature with a `sidebar_section` has a matching `@feature('<key>')` guard in the sidebar (so a new
feature can't ship nav-ungated — Non-neg #2 structural).

---

## 9. Permissions (Non-neg #5)

- New key `agency_features.manage` (module `settings`) — gates the Settings → Features section
  (sidebar entry + `feature`/`permission` route middleware + `FeatureSettingsController` check).
  `admin` gets it via all-minus-exclude; owner bypasses. `corex:sync-permissions --merge-defaults`
  on deploy (multi-tenancy §"Permissions sync").
- The registry **does not** add a permission per feature — feature ≠ permission (§3.1). Each
  module keeps its existing `access_*`/action permissions; the feature gate is the orthogonal
  layer on top.
- Onboarding wizard access is unchanged (`agency_setup.run`); the capabilities step writes through
  the same savers under the same gates.

---

## 10. User flow (step by step)

1. **Owner/admin** opens **Settings → Features** (permission `agency_features.manage`). Sees the
   registry grouped by category — each non-core feature a toggle with `explain` + `affects`; core
   features shown "Always on"; dependency-blocked children disabled with a "turn on parent" note.
2. Flips features. **Save** → `FeatureSettingsController@update` writes each changed key (module →
   `agency_features`; switchboard-six → their existing store), emits `AgencyFeatureToggled`, busts
   the request cache.
3. **Immediately**: nav re-renders with the changed set (`@feature` guards); a feature turned off
   drops from the sidebar for **every** user in the agency; its routes 404 (once phase-4 gating
   for that module has landed) or remain permission-gated only (until then).
4. **Onboarding**: a new agency's admin meets the same features in the wizard's capabilities step
   (auto-derived), and a feature left off there **skips its detail step** (adaptive gating).
5. **Re-enable** any time → the module's nav + routes + existing records return exactly as before
   (OFF hid, never deleted).

---

## 11. Input space / prevent-or-absorb (BUILD_STANDARD §2/§3)

- **Unknown feature key** (typo in `@feature`/`feature:`/config) → resolver returns `false` +
  logs a warning (fail-closed; a typo hides a feature loudly-in-logs, never silently passes).
  `corex:features:validate` + the focused test catch config typos at build time.
- **Direct URL to an off-feature route** → `CheckFeature` `abort(404)` (absorb; never a 403 that
  leaks existence, never a 500). Where phase-4 gating hasn't reached a loose route yet, the
  route's existing permission still guards it — no regression, just not-yet-defense-in-depth.
- **Dependency cascade** → child auto-off when parent off; the Settings toggle for a blocked child
  is rendered disabled (prevent) AND the resolver returns false even if a stale `agency_features`
  row says true (absorb). Cycle in config → `validate` command + test fail the build (prevent).
- **Core feature** → `enabled()` returns true before any store read; no toggle rendered; a
  `feature:properties` middleware (if ever mis-applied) still passes. Core can never be turned off.
- **Env kill-switch off** (global `config/features.php`) → feature off for everyone regardless of
  agency row (outer AND) — a platform-wide disable is honoured.
- **Missing `agency_features` row** → registry default (absorb; the common case, keeps the table
  small).
- **Owner with agency switcher active** → gate reads `effectiveAgencyId()`, so the owner sees the
  switched-into agency's features, not a blank set (the AgencyScope owner-blind-spot, memory
  [[agencyscope_owner_switcher_blindspot]] — the service reads the effective id explicitly).
- All writes via Eloquent + `BelongsToAgency` (agency-scoped auto-fill); no raw inserts.

---

## 12. Acceptance criteria

1. `config/corex-features.php` returns the catalogue; every entry has `label`, `category`,
   `explain`, `affects` (no tautology), `default`, `core`, `depends_on`, `nav_permission`,
   `settings_section`, `route_prefixes`; `corex:features:validate` passes (no cycles, keys resolve).
2. `AgencyFeatureService::enabled()` resolves per §3.5: unknown⇒false, core⇒true, env-off⇒false,
   parent-off⇒false, agency row⇒row, else default. Request-cached (one query per request).
3. A per-agency override round-trips: flip `rentals` on for Agency A ⇒ `enabled('rentals')` true
   for A, false (default) for Agency B — proven with two agencies (multi-tenant isolation).
4. `@feature`/`@endfeature` renders/hides a block; `feature('x')` helper matches the service;
   `CheckFeature` **404s** an off-feature route and passes an on one.
5. `depends_on`: turning a parent off makes the child resolve off regardless of the child's row;
   turning it back on restores the child to its own row/default.
6. Env kill-switch AND: a feature mapped to a global `config/features.php` flag that is off
   resolves off for every agency even with an `agency_features` row = true.
7. OFF hides only: disabling a module 404s its routes / hides its nav but deletes no row;
   re-enabling restores access to the pre-existing records.
8. The six switchboard toggles resolve through the registry to their existing stores, unchanged
   (`enabled('core-matches')` == the matches gate's current read).
9. Settings → Features renders the registry grouped by category with explain/affects; the saver is
   §6.1-guarded (absent key ⇒ unchanged; present "0" ⇒ off) and emits `AgencyFeatureToggled`.
10. Backfill: an existing live agency currently using a default-OFF feature gets an explicit ON
    row so deploy hides nothing; a default-ON feature needs no row; demo agencies skipped.
11. Nav: every non-core registry feature with a `sidebar_section` has a matching `@feature` guard
    in the sidebar (guard test) — a new feature cannot ship nav-ungated.
12. `AgencyFeatureToggled` fires on a real toggle (sync listener, scalar payload); catalogue entry
    added to `corex-domain-events-spec.md` §5.
13. Multi-tenancy: Agency A can never read/write Agency B's `agency_features`; no
    `withoutGlobalScope` in request code.
14. No raw error reaches a user on any bad-input path (§11); unknown key logs + fails closed.

---

## 13. Test matrix (single focused file per phase — Non-neg #13)

Phase 1: `tests/Feature/Features/AgencyFeatureGateTest.php` — default resolution, per-agency
override, core-always-on, `depends_on` cascade (+ cycle rejected), env kill-switch AND,
`CheckFeature` 404-on-off / pass-on, `@feature` render/hide, multi-tenant isolation, request-cache
(one query), unknown-key fail-closed, `corex:features:validate`. Real SA agency data
(BUILD_STANDARD §5). **Do NOT run the full suite** (Non-neg #13) — this file only.
Later phases add their own focused files (settings-saver guard extends
`AgencySetupWizardSaverGuardTest`; nav guard test; per-module route-gate tests).

---

## 14. Files to create / modify

**Phase 1 (gate plumbing) — create**
- `config/corex-features.php` — the catalogue.
- `database/migrations/xxxx_create_agency_features_table.php`
- `database/migrations/xxxx_backfill_agency_features.php`
- `app/Console/Commands/BackfillAgencyFeatures.php` (`agency:backfill-features`, idempotent)
- `app/Console/Commands/ValidateFeatures.php` (`corex:features:validate`)
- `app/Models/AgencyFeature.php`
- `app/Services/Features/AgencyFeatureService.php`
- `app/Http/Middleware/CheckFeature.php`
- `app/Events/AgencyFeatureToggled.php`
- `tests/Feature/Features/AgencyFeatureGateTest.php`

**Phase 1 — modify**
- `app/Models/User.php` — `hasFeature()`.
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` — `@feature` Blade::if (after `@permission` at :702);
  register any sync listener + the helper.
- `app/helpers.php` (or the autoloaded helpers file) — `feature()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` — `'feature'` middleware alias.
- `.ai/specs/corex-domain-events-spec.md` — `AgencyFeatureToggled` catalogue row.
- `database/schema/mysql-schema.sql` — re-dump (from TEST DB) after the migration (#12a).

**Later phases — modify (each its own prompt)**
- Phase 3 (nav): `resources/views/layouts/corex-sidebar.blade.php` — `@feature` guards per item.
- Phase 4 (routes): `routes/web.php` — `feature:<key>` on the ~61 clean prefix groups, per module.
- Phase 5 (settings): `resources/views/corex/settings.blade.php` (Features rail entry + section),
  `app/Http/Controllers/.../FeatureSettingsController.php`, `config/corex-permissions.php`
  (`agency_features.manage`).
- Phase 6 (onboarding): `app/Models/AgencyOnboardingSetup.php` + the capabilities step /
  `config/agency-onboarding-copy.php` (auto-derive from registry);
  `.ai/specs/agency-onboarding-feature-switchboard.md` (note the derive — §7.4).
- `.ai/CHAT_STARTER.md` — dated entry per phase.

## 15. Phased build sequence (one concern per prompt)

1. **Spec** (this file) — approve grain, core set, dependency edges, route-gating scope. ← *here*
2. **Phase 1 — gate plumbing** (Prompt 2): catalogue + `agency_features` + model + service +
   `hasFeature`/`feature()`/`@feature` + `CheckFeature` + alias + `AgencyFeatureToggled` +
   backfill + `AgencyFeatureGateTest`. **No nav/settings/onboarding UI.**
3. **Phase 2 — backfill verification + switchboard adapter**: wire the six switchboard keys
   through the service's store adapter; prove `enabled('core-matches')` == current matches gate.
4. **Phase 3 — nav gating**: `@feature` guards on every gated sidebar item + the nav guard test.
5. **Phase 4 — route gating (heaviest; ONE PROMPT PER MODULE)**: `feature:<key>` on each clean
   prefix group, module by module, each with its own route-gate test. Loose routes tracked/added
   per module.
6. **Phase 5 — Settings → Features page**: `FeatureSettingsController` (§6.1-guarded) + rail entry
   + section + `agency_features.manage` permission + sidebar gating.
7. **Phase 6 — onboarding auto-derive**: capabilities step iterates the registry; generalise
   `stepGates`; update the switchboard spec.
8. **Phase 7 — full verification + demo/staging deploy**: parity, `corex:sync-permissions
   --merge-defaults`, backfill on the target, CHAT_STARTER, promote.

## 16. Pillars / data-model / permissions recap (standard sections)

- **Data model:** one new table `agency_features` (§4.1); no changes to existing tables (§4.3);
  new permission `agency_features.manage` (§9); one new domain event (§3.8).
- **Permissions:** exactly one new key; feature ≠ permission (orthogonal, §3.1).
- **Multi-tenancy:** `BelongsToAgency` + `AgencyScope` on `agency_features`; `effectiveAgencyId()`
  in the service; owner cross-agency only via explicit `queryWithoutAgencyScope()` (§3.7).

---

## 17. Open decisions for Johan (confirm at approval — BEFORE any build)

1. **Grain** — is the §5.3 list (37 toggleable) the right granularity? Candidate merges:
   `commission-management`→`agency-tracker`; `ad-manager`+`marketing-suppressions`→`marketing`;
   `trust-interest`→`calculators`; `training`(LMS)+`knowledge-base`→one "Learning";
   split `docuperfect` into `documents`+`esign` (task listed E-Sign separately). Your call sets
   the row count.
2. **Which features are CORE (never toggle)?** Proposed core: dashboard, properties, contacts,
   deals(DR1), agents, my-portal, settings, company-settings, role-manager (§5.2). **Is
   `agency-tracker` core or toggleable?** The performance/worksheet spine is arguably core; I've
   listed it toggleable (default on) — confirm. Same question for `presentations` and `docuperfect`
   (listed toggleable default-on; some would argue core).
3. **Dependency edges** — confirm/deny the proposed `depends_on`: `esign`→`docuperfect` (if split);
   `leave`→`payroll` (routes nest leave under payroll — but can an agency run leave without
   payroll?); `ad-manager`/`marketing-suppressions`→`marketing`; `commission-management`→
   `agency-tracker`. Any I've missed (e.g. `commercial-evaluations`→`presentations`)?
4. **Defaults for a NEW agency** — confirm the §5.3 `def` column (which modules a brand-new agency
   gets ON out of the box). This is the "what does CoreX look like on day one" decision.
5. **Route-gating scope for v1** — accept that phase 4 gates the ~61 clean prefix groups first and
   loose routes are added per-module incrementally (nav-gating is the immediate visible win)?
6. **Global `config/features.php` mapping** — should any registry features AND against a global
   env flag (e.g. `document-library` already has `document_library_v1`; `presentations` has
   `presentations`), or keep the env layer for platform-wide kill-switches only?
7. **The six switchboard toggles keep their existing stores** (adapter, §7.2) rather than
   migrating into `agency_features` — confirm (recommended: yes, no risky data migration).

**STOP — spec only. No code until Johan approves §17.**

---

**End of spec.**
