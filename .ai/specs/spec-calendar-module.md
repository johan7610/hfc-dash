# CoreX Calendar Module — Design Spec
> Monday.com calendar on steroids, purpose-built for real estate
> Version: 1.0 — 2026-03-30

## What Monday.com Does Well (and where we beat it)

Monday.com's calendar is a **generic work management calendar** — boards with dates rendered as calendar events, automations that fire on date triggers, colour coding by status/person, day/week/month views, Google Calendar sync, and mobile access.

Where it falls short for real estate:
- It doesn't **know** what a lease expiry or mandate renewal is
- Automations require manual setup per board — nothing is auto-wired
- No concept of regulated deadlines (bond approval, FICA, suspensive conditions)
- No understanding of tenant/landlord/buyer/seller relationships
- Reminders are generic "notify someone" — no escalation chains
- No auto-generation of events from operational data

**CoreX Calendar is different.** It's not a generic calendar with manual events bolted on. It's a **real estate operations calendar** where 80% of events auto-generate from the work the agency is already doing in CoreX. The remaining 20% is manual entries. The moment an agent captures a deal, the calendar already knows every deadline. The moment a lease is signed, the renewal reminder is already set for 90 days before expiry.

## Auto-Generated Events: Where Dates Live in CoreX

This is the killer feature. Every date already captured in CoreX becomes a calendar event automatically. No agent has to create a reminder — the system does it the moment the data is entered.

### DEALS MODULE

|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Deal registered date | "New Deal: [property] — [buyer/seller]" | — |

### PORTAL SYNDICATION

| Listing expiry on portal | "Listing Expires: [property] — [portal]" | 7d, 3d before |

## Manual Events

Users can also create their own calendar events:
- Viewings / showings (property, contact, time, agent)
- Client meetings
- Valuations / CMAs
- Office meetings
- Personal reminders
- Custom recurring events (e.g. monthly trust interest capture)

Manual events have the same reminder system as auto events — configurable alerts.

---

## Calendar Views

### Month View (default)
- Traditional calendar grid
- Events colour-coded by category (deals=blue, leases=green, compliance=amber, manual=grey, overdue=red)
- Click a day to see all events, click an event to see details
- Dot indicators for days with many events

### Week View
- 7-day horizontal layout with time slots
- Events shown as blocks within time slots
- Drag-and-drop to reschedule manual events

### Day View  
- Detailed single-day view with hourly slots
- Full event details visible inline

### Agenda View
- Vertical list of upcoming events, grouped by day
- Most useful for "what's coming up" — default for the dashboard widget
- Filterable: "Show me all lease expiries in the next 90 days"

### Timeline View (Gantt-style)
- Horizontal bars showing event durations (lease periods, deal pipelines)
- Best for BM/admin to see portfolio-wide timelines
- Properties on Y-axis, time on X-axis

---

## Calendar Filters

Every view supports filtering by:
- **Agent** — see one agent's calendar or all
- **Event category** — deals, leases, compliance, prospecting, manual
- **Property** — all events for one property
- **Contact** — all events involving one person (buyer, seller, tenant, landlord)
- **Priority** — overdue, due today, due this week, due this month
- **Branch** — filter by office (data scoping applies)
- **Status** — pending, completed, overdue, dismissed

---

## Reminder Engine

### How It Works
A scheduled Laravel command runs every 15 minutes:
`php artisan calendar:process-reminders`

It scans all calendar events where:
- Event date minus reminder offset = now (within the 15-min window)
- Reminder has not already been sent for this offset
- Event is not dismissed/completed

### Reminder Configuration (3 levels)
1. **Agency defaults** — set by admin in Settings. Applied to all events unless overridden.
2. **Per-category defaults** — different reminder schedules per event type (compliance events get longer lead times than viewings)
3. **Per-event override** — user can customise reminders on any individual event

### Escalation Rules
- If a reminder is sent and no action taken within 24h, escalate to BM
- If BM doesn't act within 24h, escalate to admin
- Configurable per event category (compliance escalates faster than viewings)
- Escalation can be turned off per category

### Notification Channels
- **In-app** — bell icon notification in CoreX header, real-time count badge
- **Email** — branded agency email using the email template system
- **iCal sync** — users can subscribe to their CoreX calendar via iCal URL, which syncs to Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar automatically
- **SMS** (future) — for critical reminders (signing deadlines, compliance)

---

## Dashboard Widget

A compact calendar widget on the CoreX dashboard showing:
- Today's events (top 5)
- Overdue items (red, count badge)
- Coming this week (summary count by category)
- "View Full Calendar" link

This is the first thing agents see when they log in — immediate awareness of what's due.

## Event Auto-Generation System

### CalendarEventService

Central service that all modules call to create/update/delete calendar events:

```php
CalendarEventService::createFromDeal(Deal $deal);        // Creates all deal-related events
CalendarEventService::createFromLease(Lease $lease);      // Creates all lease-related events
CalendarEventService::createFromCompliance(User $agent);  // Creates compliance events
CalendarEventService::createManual(array $data);          // Manual event
CalendarEventService::updateFromSource($source);          // Re-syncs events when source changes
CalendarEventService::deleteForSource($source);           // Removes events when source deleted
```

### Model Observers
Each module's model fires calendar events through observers:
- `DealObserver` — on create/update: sync deal dates to calendar
- `LeaseObserver` — on create/update: sync lease dates to calendar
- `ComplianceObserver` — on FFC/training changes: sync deadlines
- `DocumentObserver` — on send-for-signing: create chase events

When a deal's bond deadline changes, the calendar event auto-updates. No manual intervention.

---

## iCal Subscription

Each user gets a unique iCal URL:
`https://corexos.co.za/calendar/ical/{token}.ics`

This URL serves a dynamically generated ICS file with all their calendar events. Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar can subscribe to this URL and auto-refresh (configurable, typically every 15-60 minutes).

Benefits:
- Agent sees CoreX events on their phone's native calendar
- No app needed — works with what they already use
- Reminders from both CoreX AND their phone's calendar
- Works offline (events synced to device)
