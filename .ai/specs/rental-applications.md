# Spec: Rental Applications (AT-392)

**Status:** Phase 1 approved by Johan 2026-09-04. This spec covers Phase 1 only.
**Ticket:** AT-392 — Rental Applications lane.

---

## Why

The Rental Application (V8) document was being sent through the full e-sign
wizard, which structurally requires the agent to be a signing party
(`ESignWizardController` auto-injects and locks an `agent` recipient row —
see AT-332 investigation). For a tenant intake form this is overkill: the
agent never needs to sign a rental application, and the wizard's multi-step
flow (property → recipients → details → fill & review → signing setup →
prepare-signing) is far more machinery than "pick a contact, send a form."

Phase 1 replaces that path with a dedicated page for this one document type.

---

## Phase 1 scope — what this build includes

1. **Dedicated page**, not the e-sign wizard. Contact **required**, property
   **optional**. Every field **optional** — nothing blocks send. Prefill
   from the contact wherever a field maps to a real `contacts` column.
2. **Fields** (from Rental Application V8):
   - Property address
   - Personal: full name, ID number, marital status, spouse name, spouse ID,
     citizenship, current residential address, email, cell, work
   - Emergency contact: name, cell, work
   - Current landlord: name, tel, current rental amount, from, to
   - Employment: employer, position, employer address, employer tel,
     monthly salary
   - Lease requirement: occupation date, rental terms, special conditions,
     adults, children
3. **Agent does not sign.** The applicant signs twice in one sitting: the
   truth-of-information declaration, and the Tenant Profile Network (TPN)
   credit-check consent.
4. **One send, two return routes**, applicant's choice:
   - (a) Download the PDF, complete by hand, scan, return — with an upload
     link so the scanned/completed copy and supporting documents come back
     into CoreX rather than an inbox.
   - (b) Tokenised link — complete online, sign both blocks, upload
     supporting documents, data lands directly against the contact.
   - (b) is modelled on the existing `/sign/{token}` mechanism
     (`SignatureRequest`/`SigningController` pattern) — reused, not
     reinvented: same token generation shape (`Str::random(64)`, uniqueness
     loop), same 14-day expiry convention, same "blocked/expired" no-identity
     -leak handling shape.
5. **Supporting documents.** Reuses the existing e-sign recipient
   supporting-document upload path's contract (allowlist
   `pdf,jpg,jpeg,png,doc,docx`, 15MB/file, max 10 files/request — see
   `SigningController::uploadSupportingDocuments()`). Required-document list
   is agency-configurable, defaulting to the V8 checklist per employment
   type (permanently employed / business owner — personal account /
   business owner — business account). **Nothing is enforced** — missing
   documents show as outstanding on the Returned Applications screen; they
   never block submission.
6. **Returned Applications** — its own menu item for the rental team.
   Status values: `sent`, `in_progress`, `returned`, `under_assessment`,
   `approved`, `declined`, `withdrawn`.
7. **Branding.** No literals. The live template (`template-97.blade.php`)
   hardcodes `letting@hfcoastal.co.za` (`:58`) and `039 315 0857` (`:77`).
   The new build reads agency email/phone/website via the same `$d()`
   accessor pattern already used in
   `docuperfect/web-templates/components/company-header.blade.php`
   (`agencies.email`, `agencies.phone` / `phone_secondary`,
   `agencies.website_url`).
8. **Navigation** (standing rule — every page ships with its nav entry the
   same day): Rentals → Rental Applications. Rentals → Returned
   Applications. Settings → Rental Applications.
9. **Soft deletes only** (`SoftDeletes`), **agency-scoped**
   (`BelongsToAgency` + global `AgencyScope`) — no exceptions.

## Explicitly OUT of Phase 1 (later phases, per Johan)

- Assessment split-screen with agency-configurable affordability calculator
  and approval routing.
- Applicant highlighting and OCR keyword marking on returned documents.

---

## Pillars

- **Contact** — required. The application is filed against a contact; the
  contact's own fields (name, ID number, email, phone, address) prefill the
  form and the PDF's Document ↔ Contact link (`document_contacts` /
  `documents.agency_id`) is how it appears on the contact record.
- **Property** — optional. When set, links via `documents.property_id` /
  `document_properties`, same convention as every other filed document.
- **Deal** — not required for Phase 1 (a rental application precedes any
  deal; nothing here creates or requires a `deals` row).
- **Agent** — the creating/sending user; recorded, never a signer.

---

## Data model

### `rental_applications`

One row per sent application. `agency_id` (BelongsToAgency), `branch_id`,
`contact_id` (NOT NULL — the one required link), `property_id` (nullable),
`created_by_user_id`, `status` (enum, see §6 above, default `sent`),
`token`, `token_expires_at`, `delivery_mode` (`download` | `online`,
nullable until the applicant picks one), plus one nullable column per V8
field listed in §2. `submitted_at`, soft deletes.

**Every V8 field column is nullable.** Per BUILD_STANDARD §2 (the
input-space rule), an empty optional field must never reach the DB and
error — nullable columns are the DB-layer half of that guarantee.

### `rental_application_signatures`

Two rows per completed application (`kind`: `declaration` | `tpn_consent`),
each with the captured signature image path, signed-at timestamp, and the
IP/user-agent of the signer — mirrors the audit shape already used for
e-sign (`SignatureAuditLog`), scoped down to what a two-signature intake
form needs.

### `rental_application_document_requirements`

Agency-configurable checklist. `agency_id`, `employment_type` (enum:
`permanently_employed`, `business_owner_personal_account`,
`business_owner_business_account`), `document_type_id` (FK to the existing,
shared `document_types` table — no parallel type system), `sort_order`.
**No agency row present ⇒ the V8 defaults apply in memory** (Rule 17-safe
pattern: never persists a hardcoded default, just returns it when nothing
is configured), so an agency that never opens the settings screen still
gets the correct, working default checklist.

### Documents

Supporting documents and the returned/scanned copy file through the
**existing, shared `documents` table** (`source_type = 'rental_application'`,
`source_id = rental_applications.id`, `agency_id` stamped from the
application) — never a parallel documents table. Contact/property linkage
uses the same pivots (`document_contacts`, `document_properties`) every
other filed document uses.

## Routes (Phase 1)

| Purpose | Route |
|---|---|
| List / create | `GET/POST corex/rental-applications` |
| Show / edit (pre-send) | `GET corex/rental-applications/{rentalApplication}` |
| Send | `POST corex/rental-applications/{rentalApplication}/send` |
| Returned Applications inbox | `GET corex/rental-applications/returned` |
| Settings — document checklist | `GET/POST corex/settings/rental-applications` |
| Public token entry | `GET rental-application/{token}` |
| Public submit | `POST rental-application/{token}/submit` |
| Public supporting-doc upload | `POST rental-application/{token}/documents` |
| PDF download (agent side, any time) | `GET corex/rental-applications/{rentalApplication}/pdf` |

---

## Permissions

- `rental_applications.view` / `rental_applications.create` /
  `rental_applications.send` — the intake page and list.
- `rental_applications.view_returned` — the Returned Applications inbox
  (rental team).
- `rental_applications.manage_settings` — the document-checklist settings
  screen.

---

## Acceptance criteria (Phase 1)

- An agent can open Rental Applications, pick a contact (required),
  optionally a property, leave every other field blank, and send — no
  validation error.
- The applicant can either download a correctly-branded PDF (agency's own
  email/phone/website, not HFC literals) or open a tokenised link.
- On the tokenised link, the applicant can fill any subset of fields,
  capture both signatures (declaration + TPN consent), upload supporting
  documents, and submit in one sitting.
- The submission is visible on the contact record and in Returned
  Applications with the correct status.
- Missing checklist documents are shown as outstanding, never block
  submission.
- Deleting an application soft-deletes it; nothing is hard-deleted.
- A second agency's data is never visible to this agency, in the list, the
  inbox, or the settings screen.

## Deploy requirements (mandatory, every environment — do not skip)

**1. Run the permission sync after every deploy that lands this feature.**
`config/corex-permissions.php` defines 4 `rental_applications.*` keys, but
they only take effect once granted to roles in `role_permissions`. This is
NOT automatic on `migrate` — the sync command must run explicitly:

```
php artisan corex:sync-permissions --merge-defaults
```

Root-caused on QA1 2026-09-07 (cc2): after this feature landed, `role_permissions`
had **zero** grant rows for any of the 4 keys, on any role, for any agency —
`hasPermission('rental_applications.view')` evaluated false for every user,
including admin, and the nav entry stayed invisible. Confirmed fixed on QA1
by running the sync (210 rows inserted, admin role only, every agency).
**Note when running this:** the command processes every permission key
missing from the DB, not just this feature's — on QA1 it also caught up one
unrelated pre-existing key (`view_photo_upload_report`, from an older
diagnostics feature that had never been synced either). That is expected
behaviour of `--merge-defaults`, not a side effect of this feature — verify
the diff on each run rather than assuming it only touches
`rental_applications.*`.

**2. The nav entry is currently placed inside the "Hidden" panel — system
owners only.** `resources/views/layouts/corex-sidebar.blade.php`'s existing
`@permission('view_rentals') @feature('rentals')`-gated "Rentals" drill-down
(which the AT-392 links were added inside) itself nests inside the sidebar's
"HIDDEN — pages hidden from agency users, visible to system owners only"
section (`$isOwner` gate, line ~11/2481 as of this writing). **This means a
normal per-agency admin — including Johan's own regular admin login,
`johan@hfcoastal.co.za` (agency-scoped, not a system-owner account) —
cannot see "Rental Applications" in the sidebar at all, no matter what
`rental_applications.*` permissions they hold.** Verified on QA1
2026-09-07: rendered a real authenticated page as that account with all 4
permissions granted — the anchor does not appear. Rendered the same page as
a genuine `super_admin`/owner account (with agency context set) — the
anchor appears correctly. This is not a data/permission problem; it is a
nav-placement decision inherited from the pre-existing "Rentals" panel, and
needs an explicit call: either move the AT-392 links out of the "Hidden"
owner-only group into a normal agency-facing section, or confirm this is
deliberately staged as owner-only for now. **Not fixed as part of this
entry — flagged for Johan/cc4 to decide**, per the "report, don't decide
unilaterally" rule.

---

## Applicant-facing fixes (Johan, 2026-09-07 — "no submit application button")

Six real defects on the public token-based side, all found by rendering the
real page for a real token (not inferred) and, for the first one, a
headless-browser screenshot — not just reading the HTML.

1. **The submit button was invisible, not absent.** Root cause: the button
   used the raw Tailwind arbitrary-value class `bg-[#0b2a4a]`. Tailwind's
   JIT compiler only emits a utility class if it can see it in a scanned
   file AT BUILD TIME — the compiled CSS bundle on this box predates this
   blade file by ~2 weeks, so the class compiled to nothing. Confirmed with
   a real headless-browser render: the button had correct dimensions, was
   Alpine-hydrated, zero console errors — but rendered as white text on an
   unstyled background against the white card behind it. Fixed with an
   inline `style="background: var(--brand-default, #0b2a4a);"`, the same
   var()-with-fallback pattern UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md already requires — this
   can never depend on a Tailwind rebuild, so it can't regress the same way.
2. **Validation-failure redirects silently discarded the applicant's typed
   answers.** `<x-rental-application-field>` and three raw textareas/one
   select read straight from `$application` (the DB row), never `old()`.
   Laravel's own validate() failure already flashes old input to the
   session correctly — the views just never read it back. Fixed in the
   component (fixes every field that uses it in one place) and the four
   raw fields individually. No error messages were shown anywhere either —
   added a summary banner plus a per-field `@error()` message.
3. **No agent notification existed at all** on a successful submission.
   Added `RentalApplicationNotifier` + `RentalApplicationReturnedMail`
   (new files, isolated from the agent-side lane's own
   `RentalApplicationMailer`), fired from `submit()` after the DB
   transaction commits (a mail failure must never roll back the
   applicant's already-saved submission). Verified via Mailpit's real HTTP
   API (`127.0.0.1:8025`) — the notification actually arrived, addressed
   to the sending agent, nothing sent to a real address (MAIL_HOST is
   Mailpit's own local listener, port 1025 — structurally cannot escape).
4. **`submit()`'s writes were not transactional.** The record save and both
   signature captures could partially land (e.g. a disk failure between
   the two signature writes) leaving `status='returned'` with only one
   signature saved — an inconsistent state with no way back. Wrapped in
   `DB::transaction()`.
5. **Supporting-document upload was silently unavailable after
   submission.** `uploadDocuments()` never blocked on status (matching the
   spec's "before OR after signing" design, mirroring the e-sign
   precedent) — but `already-submitted.blade.php` never rendered the
   upload form at all, cutting off a path the backend already supported.
   Added the same upload section already-submitted.blade.php was missing.
6. **A rejected upload (wrong file type, too large) showed neither success
   nor error** — confirmed by deliberately uploading a non-PDF file and
   getting a silent, message-free redirect. `$errors` was populated but
   nothing on either page ever displayed `supporting_files` /
   `supporting_files.*` errors. Added per those keys to both upload
   sections.

**Verified end-to-end via real HTTP requests** (curl, cookie jar, real
CSRF, against the actual live QA1 URL) against real application id=1:
malformed email → redirected back with "Test Applicant XYZ" preserved and
the exact field error shown; valid submission → DB row shows every field
persisted, both signature files genuinely exist on disk
(`Storage::exists()` confirmed); re-opening the token shows "Application
already received" with no submit form present, and a direct POST replay
with a valid CSRF for the same session was refused by `submit()`'s own
status guard (DB row and signature count unchanged, confirmed after);
document upload confirmed with a real PDF — file exists on disk, `documents`
row correctly linked to the contact; the agent-notification email was
captured by Mailpit with the correct subject and recipient.

**Also removed**: a dead, unreachable status-check branch in
`show.blade.php` — `RentalApplicationSigningController::show()` already
routes any `returned`-or-later status to the separate
`already-submitted.blade.php` view before this template is ever reached,
so the branch could never fire.
