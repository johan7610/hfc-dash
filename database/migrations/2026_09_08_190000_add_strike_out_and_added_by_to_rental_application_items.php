/**
 * AT-392 authoriser markup — Johan, verbatim: "so the auth can highlight in
 * own colour, auth what agent did and edit... remove im thinking is just a
 * strike out tick - which leaves the amount there but removes it from the
 * calcs... it shows the authoriser disagreed with a specific line rather
 * than the figure quietly vanishing. It is an audit trail, not a display
 * choice."
 *
 * struck_out_at/struck_out_by_user_id — deliberately NOT SoftDeletes. A
 * struck-out line must stay visible with a line through it and drop out of
 * the total; SoftDeletes hides the row entirely, which is the opposite of
 * what an audit trail needs here. added_by_user_id identifies a line the
 * AUTHORISER added (nullable — every existing agent-captured line, and
 * every future agent-captured line, has no value here; only the
 * authoriser's own additions ever populate it, so "null = agent's own
 * capture" needs no backfill).
