// TIMING — DemoResetSchedule::isResetDay() (checked inside demo:reset --scheduled)
// is a PURE FUNCTION OF TIME, and it is the same function the countdown banner
// reads. One computation, so the banner cannot promise a reset the scheduler does
// not perform. It deliberately replaces demo:refresh's stored last-refreshed-at
// throttle, which lived in the database the reset destroys.
//
// SAFETY — demo:reset now takes demo:refresh's backup first and REFUSES to wipe if
// that backup fails, so the safer operation survived the convergence.
//
// demo:refresh is retained as a hand-runnable command (no hard deletes) but is no
// longer scheduled; it targets a dedicated `demo` connection, which is the right
// shape for rebuilding a demo DB from ANOTHER box, not for a demo instance
// rebuilding its own.
// DISABLED 2026-09-02 per Johan, re-applied after the 2026-09-02 03:06 incident
// (this exact schedule entry re-armed itself overnight because the previous
// disable was a working-tree edit only, never committed, and got silently
// discarded by a `git reset` in this shared checkout — see git reflog around
// 2026-09-02). This time the disable is COMMITTED, and a second, independent
// guard (dev_settings.demo_reset_frozen, checked inside DemoReset::handle()
// itself) means even a future revert of THIS comment-out cannot bring the
// reset back — the command still refuses until that flag is cleared too.
// Re-enable both together once Johan says it is safe, not before.
