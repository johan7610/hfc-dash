/**
 * Agency Onboarding Setup Wizard — content + control map (single source of truth).
 *
 * Spec: .ai/specs/agency-onboarding-setup.md §5.
 *
 * Hand-written, reviewed copy — NOT AI-generated at view time (must be accurate
 * + stable). Each step declares:
 *   - key/title/intro   — plain-English framing (agent-facing, STANDARDS F.8)
 *   - what              — OPTIONAL explainer card: "What is X?" rendered above the
 *                         controls. Define the feature BEFORE asking anyone to
 *                         configure it. No jargon, no CoreX-internal codenames.
 *   - controls[]        — live fields; each names the store it reads from and
 *                         the control type. WRITES go through `savers` below.
 *       · explain       — what the setting is, in a full sentence.
 *       · affects       — rendered as "What this changes:" — a concrete,
 *                         observable consequence the admin can picture. Never a
 *                         tautology ("whether matches are computed").
 *   - savers[]          — [controller, method] pairs the wizard INVOKES on save,
 *                         so the write path is IDENTICAL to the settings page
 *                         (spec §3.1/§6 — no drift). ValidationException from a
 *                         saver bubbles to the step; a 403 (missing per-section
 *                         permission) is absorbed and the control is skipped.
 *       · pass_agency   — saver signature is (Request, Agency) rather than (Request).
 *   - partial           — rich form fields rendered INSIDE the wizard form.
 *   - aux_partial       — collection editor rendered OUTSIDE it (own sub-forms).
 *
 * Control `source`:  'agency' → Agency column | 'perf' → PerformanceSetting key
 * Control `type`:    text | textarea | number | toggle | select
